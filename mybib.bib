abstract = {We consider how variations in fault frictional properties affect the$\backslash$nphenomenology of earthquake faulting. In particular, we propose that$\backslash$nlateral variations in fault friction produce the marked heterogeneity$\backslash$nof slip observed in large earthquakes. We model these variations$\backslash$nusing a rate- and state-dependent friction law, where we differentiate$\backslash$nvelocity-weakening behavior into two fields: the strong seismic field$\backslash$nis very velocity weakening and the weak seismic field is slightly$\backslash$nvelocity weakening. Similarly, we differentiate velocity-strengthening$\backslash$nbehavior into two fields: the compliant field is slightly velocity$\backslash$nstrengthening and the viscous field is very velocity strengthening.$\backslash$nThe strong seismic field comprises the seismic slip concentrations,$\backslash$nor asperities. The two “intermediate” fields, weak seismic and compliant,$\backslash$nhave frictional velocity dependences that are close to velocity neutral:$\backslash$nthese fields modulate both the tectonic loading and the dynamic rupture$\backslash$nprocess. During the interseismic period, the weak seismic and compliant$\backslash$nregions slip aseismically, while the strong seismic regions remain$\backslash$nlocked, evolving into stress concentrations that fail only in main$\backslash$nshocks. The weak seismic areas exhibit most of the interseismic activity$\backslash$nand aftershocks but can also creep seismically. This “mixed” frictional$\backslash$nbehavior can be obtained from a sufficiently heterogeneous distribution$\backslash$nof the critical slip distance. The model also provides a mechanism$\backslash$nfor rupture arrest: dynamic rupture fronts decelerate as they penetrate$\backslash$ninto unloaded complaint or weak seismic areas, producing broad areas$\backslash$nof accelerated afterslip. Aftershocks occur on both the weak seismic$\backslash$nand compliant areas around a fault, but most of the stress is diffused$\backslash$nthrough aseismic slip. Rapid afterslip on these peripheral areas$\backslash$ncan also produce aftershocks within the main shock rupture area by$\backslash$nreloading weak fault areas that slipped in the main shock and then$\backslash$nhealed. We test this frictional model by comparing the seismicity$\backslash$nand the coseismic slip for the 1966 Parkfield, 1979 Coyote Lake,$\backslash$nand 1984 Morgan Hill earthquakes. The interevent seismicity and aftershocks$\backslash$nappear to occur on fault areas outside the regions of significant$\backslash$nslip: these regions are interpreted as either weak seismic or compliant,$\backslash$ndepending on whether or not they manifest interevent seismicity.},

abstract = {Crustal movements and deformation within the diffuse Pacific-North America (Pa-NA) plate boundary are dominated by the right-lateral motion between the two plates. By using the Pa-NA pole of rotation (PoR) spherical coordinate system, we decompose observed crustal movements into parallel and normal components to the Pa-NA plate motion. We transformed the 840 velocity vectors of the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) 3.0 velocity field into the Pa-NA PoR system in order to characterize the interseismic velocity across the plate boundary. Our results show that despite the very different deformation styles occurring across the San Andreas fault, the fault trace follows the half plate motion contour. Deviation occurs in the southern section, where the half motion contour correlates with the San Jacinto and Imperial fault segments. Our analysis yields interesting asymmetric patterns in both parallel and normal components. The parallel component shows asymmetrical velocity gradients across the San Andreas fault, and the normal component indicates compression southwest of the Big Bend, but not northeastward. The observations are compared with viscoelastic modeling results, which show a similar velocity field. The main disagreements between the observations and the model are in a narrow band along the San Andreas fault and in the Mojave block, suggesting that crustal heterogeneities and additional unmodeled fault segments should be considered in future models.},

abstract = {Theoretical results based on two different modeling approaches indicate that the seismic response of a fault system to steady tectonic loading can exhibit persisting fluctuations in the form of self-driven switching of the response back and forth between two distinct modes of activity. The first mode is associated with clusters of intense seismic activity including the largest possible earthquakes in the system and frequency-size event statistics compatible with the characteristic earthquake distribution. The second mode is characterized by relatively low moment release consisting only of small and intermediate size earthquakes and frequency-size event statistics following a truncated power law. The average duration of each activity mode scales with the time interval of a large earthquake cycle in the system. The results are compatible with various long geologic, paleoseismic, and historical records. The mode switching phenomenon may also exist in responses of other systems with many degrees of freedom and nonlinear dynamics.},

abstract = {We invert interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data jointly with campaign and continuous global positioning system (GPS) data for slip in the coseismic and postseismic periods of the 2004 Parkﬁeld earthquake. The InSAR dataset consists of eight interferograms from data collected by the Envisat and Radarsat satellites spanning the time of the earthquake and variable amounts of the postseismic period. The two datasets complement each other, with the InSAR providing dense sampling of motion in the range direction of the satellite and the GPS providing more sparse, but three-dimensional measurements of ground motion. The model assumes exponential decay of the postseismic slip with a decay time constant of 0.087 years, determined from time series modeling of continuous GPS and creepmeter data. We ﬁnd a geodetic moment magnitude of M 6.2 for a 1-day coseismic model and Mw 6.1 for the entire postseismic period. The coseismic rupture occurred mainly in two slip asperities; one near the hypocenter and the other 1520 km north. Postseismic slip occurred on the shallow portions of the fault and near the rupture areas of two M 5.0 aftershocks. A comparison of the geodetic slip models with seismic moment estimates suggests that the coseismic moment release of the Parkﬁeld earthquake is as little as 25{\%} of the total. This underlines the importance of aseismic slip in the slip budget for the Parkﬁeld segment.},

The distribution function is chosen to give a nearly constant Q over the seismic frequency range. Both discrete and continuous relaxation spectra are considered. The resulting linear solid has a broad absorption band which can be interpreted in terms of a superposition of absorption peaks of individual relaxation mechanisms.The accompanying phase and group velocity dispersion imply that one cannot directly compare body wave, surface wave, and free oscillation data or laboratory and seismic data without correcting for absorption. The necessary formalism for making these corrections is given. In the constant Q regions the correction is the same as that implied in the theories of Futterman, Lomnitz, Strick and Kolsky.},

abstract = {By virtue of the images used in the dislocation solution, the deformation at the free surface produced throughout the earthquake cycle by slippage on a long strike-slip fault in an Earth model consisting of an elastic plate (lithosphere) overlying a viscoelastic half-space (asthenosphere) can be duplicated by prescribed slip on a vertical fault embedded in an elastic half-space. For the case in which each earthquake ruptures the entire lithosphere (thickness H), the half-space equivalent slip rate is as follows: Depth interval 0-H, slip identical to that in lithosphere-asthenosphere model (i.e., abrupt coseismic slip and no subsequent slip); depth interval (2n−1)H to (2n+1)H (n = 1,2,{\ldots}), slip rate uniform in space and dependent upon time as Fn(t) exp (−t/$\tau$a) where Fn is a (n - 1) degree polynomial in t, $\tau$a is twice the asthenosphere relaxation time ($\eta$/$\mu$), and t is measured from the instant after the preceding earthquake. The slip rate averaged over the seismic cycle in each depth interval equals the secular rate of relative plate motion. For reasonable values of $\tau$a, slip rates below 5H do not vary much from that mean value and can be treated as constant. Thus the surface deformation due to the earthquake cycle in the lithosphere-asthenosphere model can be calculated very simply from the half-space model with time-dependent slip in the two depth intervals H−3H and 3H−5H, and uniform slip at a rate equal to the secular relative plate velocity below depth 5H. Inversion of 1973–1988 geodetic measurements of deformation across the segment of the San Andreas fault in the Transverse Ranges north of Los Angeles for the half-space equivalent slip distribution suggests no significant slip on the fault above 30 km and a uniform slip rate of 36 mm/yr below 30 km. One equivalent lithosphere-asthenosphere model would have a 30-km thick lithosphere and an asthenosphere relaxation time greater than 33 years, but other models are possible.},

abstract = {Major intracontinental strike-slip faults tend to mark boundaries between lithospheric blocks of contrasting mechanical properties along much of their length. Both crustal and mantle heterogeneities can form such boundaries, but the role of crustal versus mantle strength contrasts for localizing strain sufficiently to generate major faults remains unclear. Using the crustal velocity field observed through the Global Positioning System (GPS) in the epicentral area of the M7.2 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake, Baja California, we find that transient deformation observed after the event is anomalously small in areas of relatively high seismic velocity in the shallow upper mantle ({\&}{\#}8764;50 km depth). This pattern is best explained with a laterally heterogeneous viscoelastic structure that mimics the seismic structure. The mantle of the Southern Colorado River Desert (SCRD) and Peninsular Ranges (PR), which bound the fault system to its east and west, respectively, have anomalously high viscosity and seismic velocity. We hypothesize that compared with the rest of the San Andreas fault (SAF) system to its north, the strike-slip fault system in northern Baja California is narrow because of the presence of the PR and SCRD high-viscosity regions which bound it.},

Although ETS events in this area produce about two weeks of continuous tremor, we find a nearly equal amount of tremor during the last 15-month inter-ETS period. The resulting ETS and inter-ETS epicenters occur in the slow slip region where the plate interface is 30–45 km deep and have a sharp, well-resolved updip boundary about 75 km east of the downdip edge of the seismogenic megathrust zone. This ability to track tremor with high spatio-temporal resolution facilitates automatic tremor monitoring and the mapping of the transition zone and regions of locked zone stress accumulation.},

abstract = {We present a new approach to extracting spatially and temporally continuous ground deformation fields from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. We focus on unwrapped interferograms from a single viewing geometry, estimating ground deformation along the line-of-sight. Our approach is based on a wavelet decomposition in space and a general parametrization in time. We refer to this approach as MInTS (Multiscale InSAR Time Series). The wavelet decomposition efficiently deals with commonly seen spatial covariances in repeat-pass InSAR measurements, since the coefficients of the wavelets are essentially spatially uncorrelated. Our time-dependent parametrization is capable of capturing both recognized and unrecognized processes, and is not arbitrarily tied to the times of the SAR acquisitions. We estimate deformation in the wavelet-domain, using a cross-validated, regularized least squares inversion. We include a model-resolution-based regularization, in order to more heavily damp the model during periods of sparse SAR acquisitions, compared to during times of dense acquisitions. To illustrate the application of MInTS, we consider a catalog of 92 ERS and Envisat interferograms, spanning 16 years, in the Long Valley caldera, CA, region. MInTS analysis captures the ground deformation with high spatial density over the Long Valley region.},

abstract = {The abundance of geodetic and seismic data recording$\backslash$npostseismic deformation following the 2004 Parkfield earthquake provides an$\backslash$nunprecedented opportunity to resolve frictional properties on the Parkfield$\backslash$nsection of the San Andreas fault. The Parkfield segment is a transition$\backslash$nbetween the locked section to the southeast that last ruptured in the 1857 Fort$\backslash$nTejon earthquake and the creeping section to the northwest. We develop$\backslash$nthree-dimensional rate- and state-dependent friction models of afterslip$\backslash$nfollowing the 2004 earthquake to investigate the frictional behavior of the$\backslash$nfault. It is assumed that the coseismic rupture occurred on an area of the fault$\backslash$nsurrounded by aseismic creep that accelerated after the earthquake.$\backslash$nWe estimate the distribution of coseismic slip, afterslip, and rate–state$\backslash$nfrictional parameters by inverting a two-step slip model. In the model we$\backslash$n(1) estimate the coseismic slip distribution from 1-Hz Global Positioning System$\backslash$n(GPS) data and (2) use the corresponding coseismic shear stress$\backslash$nchange on the fault as input into a numerical afterslip model governed by$\backslash$nrate–state friction. We find the rate–state frictional parameter A– B, an$\backslash$nindicator of frictional stability, is in the range 10−4–10−3 at 50 MPa normal$\backslash$nstress, which is near the transition from potentially unstable (negative$\backslash$nA–B) to nominally stable (positive A–B) friction. The estimate of A–B values$\backslash$nfalls within a wide range of experimental values reported for$\backslash$nserpentinite, which crops out along the San Andreas fault zone. The critical$\backslash$nslip distance, dc, which characterizes the distance over which strength$\backslash$nbreaks down during a slip event, is in the range 0.01–0.1 m, consistent with$\backslash$nseismic estimates and a fault gouge thickness of 1–10 m. The afterslip$\backslash$nmodel reproduces most features observed in the GPS time-series data including$\backslash$nhigh surface velocities in the first few months after the earthquake and$\backslash$nlower rates at later times, as well as the cumulative postseismic displacement.$\backslash$nThe model tends to underpredict the displacement data at later times,$\backslash$nsuggesting that perhaps the modeled afterslip period ends too quickly or an$\backslash$nunmodeled deformation process dominates the signal at later times.},

abstract = {I reexamine the lower crust and mantle relaxation following two large events in the Mojave Desert: the 1992 M7.3 Landers and 1999 M7.1 Hector Mine, California, earthquakes. Time series from continuous GPS sites out to 300 km from the ruptures are used to constrain models of postseismic relaxation. Crustal motions in the Mojave Desert region are elevated above background for several years following each event. To account for broadscale relaxation of the lower crust and mantle, the Burgers body model is employed, involving transient and steady state viscosities. Joint afterslip/postseismic relaxation modeling of the GPS time series up to one decade following the Hector Mine earthquake reveals a significant rheological contrast between a northwest trending “southwest domain” (that envelopes the San Andreas fault system and western Mojave Desert) and an adjacent “northeast domain” (that envelopes the Landers and Hector Mine rupture areas in the central Mojave Desert). The steady state viscosity of the northeast domain mantle asthenosphere is inferred to be ∼4 times greater than that of the southwest domain. This pattern is counter to that expected for regional heat flow, which is higher in the northeast domain, but it is explicable by means of a nonlinear rheology that includes dependence on both strain rate and water concentration. I infer that the southwest domain mantle has a relatively low steady state viscosity because of its high strain rate and water content. The relatively low mantle water content of the northeast domain is interpreted to result from the continual extraction of water through igneous and volcanic activity over the past ∼20 Myr.},

abstract = {We analyze the cycle of great earthquakes along the San Andreas fault with a finite element numerical model of deformation in a crust with a nonlinear viscoelastic rheology. The viscous component of deformation has an effective viscosity that depends exponentially on the inverse absolute temperature and nonlinearity on the shear stress; the elastic deformation is linear. Crustal thickness and temperature are constrained by seismic and heat flow data for California. The models are for anti plane strain in a 25-km-thick crustal layer having a very long, vertical strike-slip fault; the crustal block extends 250 km to either side of the fault. During the earthquake cycle that lasts 160 years, a constant plate velocity v(sub p)/2 = 17.5 mm yr is applied to the base of the crust and to the vertical end of the crustal block 250 km away from the fault. The upper half of the fault is locked during the interseismic period, while its lower half slips at the constant plate velocity. The locked part of the fault is moved abruptly 2.8 m every 160 years to simulate great earthquakes. The results are sensitive to crustal rheology. Models with quartzite-like rheology display profound transient stages in the velocity, displacement, and stress fields. The predicted transient zone extends about 3-4 times the crustal thickness on each side of the fault, significantly wider than the zone of deformation in elastic models. Models with diabase-like rheology behave similarly to elastic models and exhibit no transient stages. The model predictions are compared with geodetic observations of fault-parallel velocities in northern and central California and local rates of shear strain along the San Andreas fault. The observations are best fit by models which are 10-100 times less viscous than a quartzite-like rheology. Since the lower crust in California is composed of intermediate to mafic rocks, the present result suggests that the in situ viscosity of the crustal rock is orders of magnitude less the rock viscosity determined in the laboratory.},

abstract = {Geologic, experimental, and geodetic studies indicate that ductile shear zones do not deform in steady state. We present a theoretical model for an elastically loaded ductile shear zone deforming by combined dislocation and diffusion creep, in which grain size is allowed to evolve toward its equilibrium (recrystallized) value. Several grain size evolution laws are considered. Simulations of laboratory experiments show that grain size evolution can lead to changes in the dominant deformation mechanism that are accompanied by transient strain-weakening or strain-strengthening episodes reminiscent of laboratory observations. Ductile shear zones can also produce postseismic creep as observed in geodetic data following large earthquakes. Non-steady-state ductile creep is difficult to differentiate from frictional sliding with velocity-strengthening friction. Hence, ductile creep may play a role in the transition from velocity-weakening to velocity-strengthening friction with increasing temperature. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {It is well known that slip rate estimates from geodetic data are nonunique because they depend on model assumptions and parameters that are often not known a priori. Estimates of fault slip rate on the Mojave segment of the San Andreas fault system derived from elastic block models and GPS data are significantly lower than estimates from geologic data. To determine the extent to which the slip rate discrepancy might be due to the oversimplified models of the rheology of the lithosphere, we develop a two-dimensional linear Maxwell viscoelastic earthquake cycle model and simultaneously estimate fault slip rates and lithosphere viscosity structure in the Mojave region. The model consists of episodic earthquakes in an elastic crust overlying layers with different viscosities that represent the lower crust, uppermost mantle, and upper mantle. We use GPS measurements of postseismic relaxation following the 1992 Landers earthquake, triangulation measurements spanning 1932–1977, GPS measurements of the contemporary velocity field, and paleoseismic data along the San Andreas fault. We infer lower crustal (15–30 km depth) viscosity of 10 19 – 10 20 Pa s, uppermost mantle (30–60 km) viscosity of 10 20 – 22 Pa s, and underlying upper mantle viscosity of 10 18 – 10 19 Pa s, consistent with inferences from laboratory experiments of relatively high-viscosity lithospheric mantle and lower-viscosity lower crust and underlying asthenospheric mantle. We infer a 20–30 mm/yr slip rate on the San Andreas fault, in agreement with the lower end of geologic estimates. Inversions of geodetic data with models that do not incorporate layered viscosity structure may significantly misestimate slip rates.},

abstract = {We analyze five years of Southern California GPS data following the Mw=7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake. We observed transient postseismic deformation which persists for three years at epicentral distances greater than ∼200 km. In the near-field, rapid postseismic transience decays to a sustained rate which exceeds its preseismic trend. We attempt to determine the mechanisms driving this deformation, where we consider afterslip at seismogenic depths and viscoelastic relaxation in the lower crust and upper mantle as candidate mechanisms. We find that early, rapid, near-field deformation can be explained with afterslip on the fault that ruptured coseismically. The later, sustained, near-field deformation can be explained with viscoelastic relaxation in the lower crust with a steady-state viscosity of ∼1019 Pa s and possibly continued afterslip. The later postseismic deformation in the far-field is best explained with a transient viscosity of ∼1018 Pa s in the upper mantle. We argue that a transient rheology in the mantle is preferable over a Maxwell rheology because it better predicts the decay in postseismic deformation, and also because it does not conflict with the generally higher, steady-state viscosities inferred from studies of geophysical processes occurring over longer time scales.},

abstract = {Fault zone architecture and related permeability structures form primary controls on fluid flow in upper-crustal, brittle fault zones. We develop qualitative and quantitative schemes for evaluating fault-related permeability structures by using results of field investigations, laboratory permeability measurements, and numerical models of flow within and near fault zones. The qualitative scheme compares the percentage of the total fault zone width composed of fault core materials (e.g., anastomosing slip surfaces, clay-rich gouge, cataclasite, and fault breccias) to the percentage of subsidiary damage zone structures (e.g., kinematically related fracture sets, small faults, and veins). A more quantitative scheme is developed to define a set of indices that characterize fault zone architecture and spatial variability. The fault core and damage zone are distinct structural and hydrogeologic units that reflect the material properties and deformation conditions within a fault zone. Whether a fault zone will act as a conduit, barrier, or combined conduit-barrier system is controlled by the relative percentage of fault core and damage zone structures and the inherent variability in grain scale and fracture permeability. This paper outlines a framework for understanding, comparing, and correlating the fluid flow properties of fault zones in various geologic settings.},

Nevertheless, comparison of spatial and temporal variations in deformation rate with time-dependent mechanical models can place valuable constraints on fault zone geometry and rheology. We consider postseismic strain rate transients by comparing geodetic data from north of San Francisco Bay obtained between 1906 and 1995 to predictions from viscoelastic finite element models. Models include (1) an elastic plate over a viscoelastic half-space, (2) distributed shear within a viscoelastic layer, (3) discrete shear zones within an otherwise elastic layer, (4) discrete shear zones in combination with distributed viscoelastic shear, and (5) midcrustal detachment surfaces. We vary, as applicable, locking depth, elastic thickness, depth to the top and bottom of the distributed shear layer, distributed shear relaxation time, discrete shear zone relaxation time, and discrete shear zone width. The best fitting, physically reasonable elastic plate over viscoelastic half-space models (1) do a poor job simultaneously predicting spatial and temporal variations in the data. The best fitting distributed shear models (2) do a poor job predicting spatial variations in the deformation rate. Although they fit the geodetic data, recent findings from seismic reflection-refraction studies in northern California argue against models with shallow subhorizontal detachments (5). Models incorporating discrete shear zones (3, 4) provide the best fit to the geodetic data and are consistent with seismic studies that argue for discrete fault zones extending through the entire crust.},

abstract = {Slip nucleation during earthquakes is apparently analogous to rupture nucleation within an intact rock sample subjected to triaxial loading. The observations indicate that both these nucleation processes initiate within a relatively small volume and in both the slip propagates unstably along a quasi-planar surface. In both processes a single, pre-existing, shear fracture cannot nucleate the large-scale slip, and in both a 'process zone' that includes several interacting fractures in a small volume are required to initiate the unstable slip. Both processes require rupture of intact rocks, generate complex fracture geometry, and are associated with intense energy-release rate during slip. Recent observations and analyses are used to correlate rupture nucleation in laboratory tests with nucleation events of large earthquakes. It is proposed that earthquake nucleation occurs by the interaction among multiple fractures within a small volume that develops into unstable yielding of the healed fault zone.},

Like the conventional differential quadrature (DQ) method, it discretizes any derivative at a knot by a weighted linear sum of functional values at its neighbouring knots, which may be distributed randomly. However, different from the conventional DQ method, the weighting coefficients in present method are determined by taking the radial basis functions (RBFs) instead of high order polynomials as the test functions. The method works in a similar fashion as conventional finite difference schemes but with “truly” mesh-free property. In this paper, we mainly concentrate on the multiquadric RBFs since they have exponential convergence. The effects of shape parameter c on the accuracy of numerical solution of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations are studied, and how the value of optimal c varies with the number of local support knots is also numerically demonstrated. The proposed method is validated by its application to the simulation of natural convection in a square cavity. Excellent numerical results are obtained on an irregular knot distribution.},

abstract = {[1] Postseismic deformation is well documented in geodetic data collected in the aftermath of large earthquakes. In the postseismic time interval, GPS is most sensitive to creep in the lower crust or upper mantle activated by earthquake-generated stress perturbations. In these regions, deformation may be localized on an aseismic frictional surface or on a ductile shear zone. These two hypotheses imply specific rheologies and therefore time dependence of postseismic creep. Hence postseismic creep constitutes a potential probe into the rheology of aseismic regions of the lithosphere. I present a simple shear zone model of postseismic creep in which the rheology of the creeping element can be varied. In the absence of tectonic loading during the postseismic time interval, the displacement history of the shear zone obeying a power law rheology with stress exponent n follows an analytical relaxation curve parameterized by 1/n. For a frictional surface, postseismic creep follows the same relaxation law in the limit 1/n ! 0. A rough estimate of the apparent stress exponent can be obtained from continuous GPS records. Application to data collected after the 1994 Sanriku earthquake yields 1/n   0.1, which is consistent with dislocation creep mechanisms. However, the records of two other subduction zone events, the 2001 Peru event and the 1997 Kronotski earthquake, and a continental strike-slip earthquake, the 1999 I : zmit earthquake, require negative 1/n. Rather than characterizing the shear zone rheology, these negative exponents indicate that reloading of the shear zone by tectonic forces is important. Numerical simulations of postseismic deformation with nonnegligible reloading produce curves that are well fit by the generalized relaxation law with 1/n {\textless} 0, although the actual stress exponent of the rheology is positive. While this prevents rheology from being tightly constrained by the studied GPS records, it indicates that reloading is important in the postseismic time interval. In other words, the stress perturbation induced by an earthquake is comparable to the stress supported by ductile shear zones in the interseismic period.},

abstract = {We investigate the finite rupture processes of two M{\textgreater}5 earthquakes in the 2012 Brawley swarm by joint inversion of nearby strong motion and high-rate GPS data. Waveform inversions up to 3Hz were made possible by using a small event (Mw3.9) for path calibration of the velocity structure. Our results indicate that the first (Mw5.3) event ruptured a strong, concentrated asperity with offsets of {\~{}}20cm centered at a depth of 5 km. The subsequent Mw5.4 event occurred 1.5 hours later with a shallower slip distribution that surrounds and is complementary to that of the earlier event. The second event has a longer rise time and weaker high frequency energy release compared to the Mw5.3 event. Both events display strong rupture directivity towards southwest and lack of very shallow ({\textless}2km) co-seismic slip. The hypocenters for these events appear to be near or in the bedrock, but most of the slip is distributed at shallower depths ({\textless}6km) and can explain a large part of the GPS offsets for the swarm. The complementary slip distributions of the two events suggest a triggering relationship between them with no significant creep needed to explain the various data sets.},

abstract = {We estimate the velocity field in central and southern California using Global Positioning System (GPS) observations from 1986 to 1992 and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations from 1984 to 1991. Our core network includes 12 GPS sites spaced approximately 50 km apart, mostly in the western Transverse Ranges and the coastal Borderlands. The precision and accuracy of the relative horizontal velocities estimated for these core stations are adequately described by a 95{\%} confidence ellipse with a semiminor axis of approximately 2 mm/yr oriented roughly north-south, and a semimajor axis of approximately 3 mm/yr oriented east-west. For other stations, occupied fewer than 5 times, or occupied during experiments with poor tracking geometries, the uncertainty is larger. These uncertainties are calibrated by analyzing the scatter in three types of comparisons: (1) multiple measurements of relative position (“repeatability”), (2) independent velocity estimates from separate analyses of the GPS and VLBI data, and (3) rates of change in baseline length estimated from the joint GPS+VLBI solution and from a comparison of GPS with trilateration. The dominant tectonic signature in the velocity field is shear deformation associated with the San Andreas and Garlock faults, which we model as resulting from slip below a given locking depth. Removing the effects of this simple model from the observed velocity field reveals residual deformation that is not attributable to the San Andreas fault. Baselines spanning the eastern Santa Barbara Channel, the Ventura basin, the Los Angeles basin, and the Santa Maria Fold and Thrust Belt are shortening at rates of up to 5 ± 1, 5 ± 1, 5 ± 1, and 2 ± 1 mm/yr, respectively. North of the Big Bend, some compression normal to the trace of the San Andreas fault can be resolved on both sides of the fault. The rates of rotation about vertical axes in the residual geodetic velocity field differ by up to a factor of 2 from those inferred from paleomagnetic declinations. Our estimates indicate that the “San Andreas discrepancy” can be resolved to within the 3 mm/yr uncertainties by accounting for deformation in California between Vandenberg (near Point Conception) and the westernmost Basin and Range. Strain accumulation of 1–2 mm/yr on structures offshore of Vandenberg is also allowed by the uncertainties. South of the Transverse Ranges, the deformation budget must include 5 mm/yr between the offshore islands and the mainland.},

abstract = {We present a resolution analysis of an inversion of GPS data from the 2004 Mw 6.0 Parkfield earthquake. This earthquake was recorded at thirteen 1-Hz GPS receivers, which provides for a truly coseismic data set that can be used to infer the static slip field.We find that the resolution of our inverted slip model is poor at depth and near the edges of the modeled fault plane that are far from GPS receivers. The spatial heterogeneity of the model resolution in the static field inversion leads to artifacts in poorly resolved areas of the fault plane. These artifacts look qualitatively similar to asperities commonly seen in the final slip models of earthquake source inversions, but in this inversion they are caused by a surplus of free parameters. The location of the artifacts depends on the station geometry and the assumed velocity structure. We demonstrate that a nonuniform gridding of model parameters on the fault can remove these artifacts from the inversion. We generate a nonuniform grid with a grid spacing that matches the local resolution length on the fault and show that it outperforms uniform grids, which either generate spurious structure in poorly resolved regions or lose recoverable information in well-resolved areas of the fault. In a synthetic test, the nonuniform grid correctly averages slip in poorly resolved areas of the fault while recovering small-scale structure near the surface. Finally, we present an inversion of the Parkfield GPS data set on the nonuniform grid and analyze the errors in the final model.},

The relatively dense coverage of continuous GPS (cGPS) within western North America, through EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO), enables the possibility of detecting crustal strain transient phenomena on a variety of spatial and temporal scales (Ohtani et al., 2010; Ji and Herring, 2011). In this paper we present a geodetic network‐processing tool for detection of anomalous strain transients in Southern California, or within any region with reasonably dense cGPS coverage. The modeling procedure determines time‐dependent displacement gradient fields from cGPS time series (Hernandez et al., 2005; Hernandez, 2007) and determines the significance of any departures of this field relative to a geodetic reference model. The derived field satisfies strain‐rate compatibility relations everywhere within the plate boundary zone on a sphere. Given sufficient spatial coverage of cGPS, the method can detect anomalous strain, either from shear or volume sources, and either on or off the known faults.},

abstract = {Models of postseismic deformation following the 2002 M 7.9 Denali Fault, Alaska earthquake provide insight into the rheologic structure of the Alaskan lithosphere and the physical processes activated following a large earthquake. We model coseismic GPS displacements and 4 yr of postseismic GPS position time-series with a coupled model of afterslip on the fault in the lithosphere and distributed viscous ﬂow in the asthenosphere. Afterslip is assumed to be governed by a simpliﬁed version of a laboratory-derived rate-strengthening friction law that is characterized with a single parameter, $\sigma$(a − b), where $\sigma$ is the effective normal stress on the fault and a − b is a dimensionless empirical parameter. Afterslip is driven by coseismic stress changes on the fault generated by the main shock. The lithosphere is modelled as an elastic plate overlying a linear, Maxwell, viscoelastic asthenosphere. We devise a scheme to simultaneously estimate the distributions of coseismic slip and afterslip, friction parameters, lithosphere thickness and asthenosphere viscosity. The postseismic GPS time-series are best reproduced with a 45–85 km thick elastic lithosphere overlying an asthenosphere of viscosity 0.6–1.5 × 10 19 Pa s. The 45–85 km elastic lithosphere thickness is greater than or equal to the average crustal thickness in the region suggesting that distributed postseismic ﬂow occurs largely within the mantle while postseismic deformation in the crust is conﬁned largely to slip on a discrete fault penetrating the entire crust and perhaps into the uppermost mantle. For typical laboratory values of a − b of order 10−2 at temperatures corresponding to the inferred depth of afterslip, the estimated effective normal stress on the fault is ∼50 MPa, which is about an order of magnitude lower than effective normal stresses at hydrostatic pore pressure. Previous studies showed that models with linear Newtonian rheology cannot reproduce the observed GPS time-series but that models incorporating non-linear or biviscous ﬂow of the mantle do ﬁt the data. We show that a model with afterslip governed by a non-linear fault zone rheology coupled to Newtonian mantle ﬂow is sufﬁcient to reproduce the GPS time-series.},

abstract = {The M7.9 2002 Denali earthquake, Alaska, is one of the largest strike- slip earthquakes ever recorded. The postseismic GPS velocity field around the 300- km- long rupture is characterized by very rapid horizontal velocity up to similar to 300 mm/ yr for the first 0.1 years and slower but still elevated horizontal velocity up to similar to 100 mm/ yr for the succeeding 1.5 years. I find that the spatial and temporal pattern of the displacement field may be explained by a transient mantle rheology. Representing the regional upper mantle as a Burghers body, I infer steady state and transient viscosities of eta(1) = 2.8 x 10(18) Pa s and eta(2) = 1.0 x 10(17) Pa s, respectively, corresponding to material relaxation times of 1.3 and 0.05 years. The lower crustal viscosity is poorly constrained by the considered horizontal velocity field, and the quoted mantle viscosities assume a steady state lower crust viscosity that is 7 eta(1). Systematic bias in predicted versus observed velocity vectors with respect to a fixed North America during the first 3 - 6 months following the earthquake is reduced when all velocity vectors are referred to a fixed site. This suggests that the post- Denali GPS time series for the first 1.63 years are shaped by a combination of a common mode noise source during the first 3 - 6 months plus viscoelastic relaxation controlled by a transient mantle rheology.},

abstract = {Automatically detected and located tremor epicenters from episodic tremor and slip (ETS) episodes in northern Cascadia provide a high-resolution map of Washington's slow slip region. Thousands of epicenters from the past four ETS events from 2004 to 2008 provide detailed map-view constraints that correlate with geodetic estimates of the simultaneous slow slip. Each of these ETS events exhibits remarkable similarity in the timing and geographic distribution of tremor density and geodetically inferred slip. Analysis of the latest 15-month inter-ETS period also reveals ageodetic tremor activity similar both in duration and extent to ETS tremor. Epicenters from both ETS and inter-ETS tremor are bounded between the 30- and 45-km plate interface depth contours and locate approximately 75 km east of previous estimates of the locked portion of the subducting Juan de Fuca plate. Inter-ETS tremor overlaps but is generally downdip of ETS tremor and does not yet correlate with geodetically observed slip, but this is likely because the slip is below current GPS detection levels. Based on the tremor and slip correlation and the tremor-duration and slip magnitude relationship, we suggest that the well-resolved, sharp updip edge of tremor epicenters reflects a change in plate interface coupling properties. The region updip of this boundary may accumulate stress with the potential for coseismic shear failure during a megathrust earthquake. Alternatively, plate convergence in this region could be accommodated by continuous slow slip with no detectable tremor or by slow slip events with sufficiently long recurrence intervals that none have been detected during the past 10 years of GPS observations.},

abstract = {Parkfield, California, which experienced M 6.0 earthquakes in 1934, 1966, and 2004, is one of the few locales for which geodetic observations span multiple earthquake cycles. We undertake a comprehensive study of deformation over the most recent earthquake cycle and explore the results in the context of geodetic data collected prior to the 1966 event. Through joint inversion of the variety of Parkfield geodetic measurements (trilateration, two-color laser, and Global Positioning System), including previously unpublished two-color data, we estimate the spatial distribution of slip and slip rate along the San Andreas using a fault geometry based on precisely relocated seismicity. Although the three most recent Parkfield earthquakes appear complementary in their along-strike distributions of slip, they do not produce uniform strain release along strike over multiple seismic cycles. Since the 1934 earthquake, more than 1 m of slip deficit has accumulated on portions of the fault that slipped in the 1966 and 2004 earthquakes, and an average of 2 m of slip deficit exists on the 33 km of the fault southeast of Gold Hill to be released in a future, perhaps larger, earthquake. It appears that the fault is capable of partially releasing stored strain in moderate earthquakes, maintaining a disequilibrium through multiple earthquake cycles. This complicates the application of simple earthquake recurrence models that assume only the strain accumulated since the most recent event is relevant to the size or timing of an upcoming earthquake. Our findings further emphasize that accumulated slip deficit is not sufficient for earthquake nucleation.},

abstract = {The velocity field within a 100-km-broad zone centered on the San Andreas Fault between the Mexican border and San Francisco Bay has been inferred from repeated surveys of trilateration networks in the 1973-1989 interval. The velocity field has the appearance of a shear flow that remains parallel to the local strike of the fault even through such major deflections as the big bend of the San Andreas Fault in the Transverse Ranges of southern California. Across-strike profiles of the fault-parallel component of velocity exhibit the expected sigmoidal shape, whereas across-strike profiles of the fault-normal component of velocity are flat and featureless. No significant convergence upon the fault is observed even along the big bend sector. Simple dislocation models can explain most of the features of the observed velocity field, but those explanations are not unique. About 35 mm/yr of relative plate motion is accounted for within the span of the trilateration networks. Geologic studies indicate that the secular slip rate on the San Andreas fault is about 35 mm/yr. Most of the strain accumulation is probably elastic and will be recovered in subsequent earthquakes. -from Authors},

abstract = {On November 8 1997 a M-w 7.6 earthquake occurred in the Manyi region of northern Tibet, near the western end of the Kunlun Fault. Over 7 m of left-lateral slip occurred on a 200-km-long fault. Here we use InSAR observations of post-seismic surface deformation following the Manyi earthquake to investigate possible causal mechanisms. Time-series of deformation are constructed from 26 interferograms, covering the entire length of the fault for nearly 4 yr after the earthquake. Three different modelling approaches are used to try and understand the observed variations in surface displacement. First order poroelastic models predict displacement fields which do not match those observed. Modelling of viscoelastic stress relaxation in a half-space with standard linear solid rheology beneath an elastic lid provides a reasonable fit to the observations, and demonstrates that two relaxation times are needed to characterize the post-seismic transient. The best-fitting viscosity is 4 pound 10(18) Pa s, and the fully-relaxed shear modulus is 32 per cent of the purely elastic value. A model with a Maxwell viscoelastic half-space underlying the lid cannot explain the observations: at later times, larger viscosities are required than at earlier times. This increase in effective viscosity with time may be consistent with stress relaxation occurring in a power-law rheology. The time-series are also inverted for distributed afterslip on an extension of the coseismic rupture. Along-strike correlation of coseismic and post-seismic slip maxima suggests that afterslip is a plausible mechanism. The maximum slip in the afterslip model is 0.72 m after 3 yr, and the equivalent moment release is approximately 20 per cent of the coseismic moment. This study shows that it is possible to rule out certain mechanisms as the dominant post-seismic process, but with the current InSAR data set it is difficult to distinguish between other plausible options.},

Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers {\&} results.},

@article{Savage1983,
abstract = {Strain accumulation and release at a subduction zone are attributed to stick slip on the main thrust zone and steady aseismic slip on the remainder of the plate interface. This process can be described as a superposition of steady state subduction and a repetitive cycle of slip on the main thrust zone, consisting of steady normal slip at the plate convergence rate plus occasional thrust events that recover the accumulated normal slip. Because steady state subduction does not contribute to the deformation at the free surface, deformation observed there is completely equivalent to that produced by the slip cycle alone. The response to that slip is simply the response of a particular earth model to embedded dislocations. For a purely elastic earth model, the deformation cycle consists of a coseismic offset followed by a linear-in-time recovery to the initial value during the interval between earthquakes. For an elastic-viscoelastic earth model (elastic lithosphere over a viscoelastic asthenosphere), the postearthquake recovery is not linear in time. Records of local uplift as a function of time indicate that the long-term postseismic recovery is approximately linear, suggesting that elastic earth models are adequate to describe the deformation cycle. However, the deformation predicted for a simple elastic half-space earth model does not reproduce the deformation observed along the subduction zones in Japan at all well if stick slip is restricted to the main thrust zone. As recognized earlier by Shimazaki, Seno, and Kato, the uplift profiles could be explained if stick slip were postulated to extend along the plate interface beyond the main thrust zone to a depth of perhaps 100 km, but independent evidence suggests that stick slip at such depths is unlikely.},

abstract = {We developed a new inversion method to reconstruct static images of seismic sources from geodetic data, using Akaike's Bayesian Information Criterion (ABIC).  Coseismic surface displacements are generally related with a slip distribution on a fault surface by linear integral equations.  Parametric expansion of the fault slip distribution by a finite number of known basis functions yields a set of observation equations expressed in a simple vector form.  Incorporating prior constraints on the smoothness of slip distribution with the observation equations, we construct a Bayesian model with unknown hyperparameters.  The optimal values of the hyperparameters, which control the structure of the Bayesian model, are objectively determined from observed data by using ABIC.  Once the values of hyperparameters are determined, we can use the maximum likelihood method to find the optimal distribution of fault slip.  We examined the validity of this method through a numerical experiment using theoretical data with random noise.  We analysed geodetic data associated with the 1946 Nankaido earthquake (M(s) = 8.2) by using this method.  The result shows that the fault slip distribution of this earthquake has two main peaks of 4 and 6 m, located off Kii Peninsula and Muroto Promontory.  These two high-slip areas are clearly separated by a low-slip zone extending along Kii Strait.  Such a slip distribution corresponds with the fact that the rupture process of this earthquake in the western part is notably different from that in the eastern part.},

abstract = {Prior to the 2011 M9 Tohoku-oki earthquake, subduction at the Japan Trench was characterized by M7-8 earthquakes, sometimes rupturing the same source regions (seismic asperities), followed by extensive afterslip detected by GPS measurements. A physically-based model consisting of velocity-weakening asperities surrounded by aseismic creep on velocity-strengthening regions (the ‘rate-state asperity model') became the prevailing conceptual model for earthquakes in this region. Theory and numerical simulation indicates that velocity-weakening areas do not exhibit sustained afterslip, while velocity-strengthening regions do not accumulate stress interseismically. Here we demonstrate that the rate-state asperity model is contradicted by models of postseismic deformation following the Tohoku-oki earthquake: afterslip in the first eight months either occurred on historical seismic asperities or stress accumulated in regions surrounding the asperities. Unsmoothed inversions of cumulative 8-month postseismic GPS displacements that restrict afterslip to areas outside of historical ruptures cannot fit the data without afterslip exceeding the slip that fully relaxes the coseismic stress change. In contrast, similarly constrained inversions allowing slip within historical ruptures can satisfactorily fit the postseismic displacements. These results require a modification of the rate-state asperity model and raise new questions about physical processes and properties of the subduction interface.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigate the extent to which viscoelastic velocity perturbations (or “ghost transients”) from individual fault segments can affect elastic block model-based inferences of fault slip rates from GPS velocity fields. We focus on the southern California GPS velocity field, exploring the effects of known, large earthquakes for two end-member rheological structures. Our approach is to compute, at each GPS site, the velocity perturbation relative to a cycle average for earthquake cycles on particular fault segments. We then correct the SCEC CMM4.0 velocity field for this perturbation and invert the corrected field for fault slip rates. We find that if asthenosphere viscosities are low (3 × 1018 Pa s), the current GPS velocity field is significantly perturbed by viscoelastic earthquake cycle effects associated with the San Andreas Fault segment that last ruptured in 1857 (Mw = 7.9). Correcting the GPS velocity field for this perturbation (or “ghost transient”) adds about 5 mm/a to the SAF slip rate along the Mojave and San Bernardino segments. The GPS velocity perturbations due to large earthquakes on the Garlock Fault (most recently, events in the early 1600s) and the White Wolf Fault (most recently, the Mw = 7.3 1952 Kern County earthquake) are smaller and do not influence block-model inverted fault slip rates. This suggests that either the large discrepancy between geodetic and geologic slip rates for the Garlock Fault is not due to a ghost transient or that un-modeled transients from recent Mojave earthquakes may influence the GPS velocity field.},

abstract = {Ultimately, seismotectonic studies seek to provide ways of assessing the timing, magnitude and spatial extent of future earthquakes. Ample observations document the spatial variability in interseismic coupling, defined as a degree of locking of a fault during the period of stress build-up between seismic events: fully or nearly locked fault patches are often surrounded by aseismically creeping areas. However, it is unclear how these observations could help assess future earthquakes. Here we simulate spontaneous seismic and aseismic fault slip with a fully dynamic numerical model. Our simulations establish the dependence of earthquake rupture patterns and interseismic coupling on spatial variations of fault friction.We consider the long-term evolution of slip on a model fault where two seismogenic, locked segments are separated by an aseismically slipping patch where rupture is impeded.We find that the probability for a large earthquake to break through the rupture-impeding patch is correlated with the interseismic coupling averaged over this patch. In addition, the probability that an earthquake breaks through the rupture-impeding patch and interseismic coupling are both related to fault friction properties through a single non-dimensional parameter. Our study opens the possibility of predicting seismic rupture patterns that a fault system can produce on the basis of observations of its interseismic coupling, and suggests that regions of low interseismic coupling may reveal permanent barriers to large earthquakes.},

abstract = {We invert for the time-dependent slip history of slow slip events on the Cascadia subduction zone using GPS data from 1998 to 2008. The 16 slip transients have sufficient station coverage to solve for the slip distribution on the plate interface. GPS time series are inverted for fault slip using the Extended Network Inversion Filter. Limited station coverage south of Portland (45.5 degrees N latitude) restricts our analysis to events on the northern half of the subduction zone. Slip is resolved at the base of the seismogenic zone and the slip distributions suggest a potential segment boundary near Seattle (47.6 degrees N) that correlates roughly with geologic and tectonic boundaries. Events that initiate to the north and south tend to overlap at about this latitude. We compile statistics on source parameters, such as propagation rate, recurrence interval, and stress drop, which can be used to constrain proposed models of the source mechanics. Over a 10 year period, total strain release from slow slip events is nonuniform along strike with the greatest cumulative slip (27 cm) centered beneath Port Angeles (48.1 degrees N). This slip patch also exhibits the most regular recurrence of Mw similar to 6 events relative to other locations along strike. The spatial extent of the slip patch beneath Port Angeles correlates with the along-strike bend of the Cascadia subduction zone in northwestern Washington, suggesting that plate geometry plays an important role in controlling the along-strike characteristics of slow slip.},

It presents those parts of the theory which are especially useful in calculations and stresses the representation of splines as linear combinations of B-splines. After two chapters summarizing polynomial approximation, a rigorous discussion of elementary spline theory is given involving linear, cubic and parabolic splines. The computational handling of piecewise polynomial functions (of one variable) of arbitrary order is the subject of chapters VII and VIII, while chapters IX, X, and XI are devoted to B-splines. The distances from splines with fixed and with variable knots is discussed in chapter XII. The remaining five chapters concern specific approximation methods, interpolation, smoothing and least-squares approximation, the solution of an ordinary differential equation by collocation, curve fitting, and surface fitting. The present text version differs from the original in several respects. The book is now typeset (in plain TeX), the Fortran programs now make use of Fortran 77 features. The figures have been redrawn with the aid of Matlab, various errors have been corrected, and many more formal statements have been provided with proofs. Further, all formal statements and equations have been numbered by the same numbering system, to make it easier to find any particular item. A major change has occured in Chapters IX-XI where the B-spline theory is now developed directly from the recurrence relations without recourse to divided differences. This has brought in knot insertion as a powerful tool for providing simple proofs concerning the shape-preserving properties of the B-spline series.},

@article{Savage2001,
abstract = {Although the Eastern California Shear Zone (ECSZ) (strike similar to N25 degreesW) does not quite coincide with a small circle drawn about the Pacific-North America pole of rotation, trilateration and GPS measurements demonstrate that the motion within the zone corresponds to right-lateral simple shear across a vertical plane (strike N33 degreesW +/-5 degrees) roughly parallel to the tangent to that local small circle (strike similar to N40 degreesW). If the simple shear is released by slip on faults subparallel to the shear zone, the accumulated rotation is also released, leaving no secular rotation. South of the Garlock fault the principal faults (e.g., Calico-Blackwater fault) strike similar to N40 degreesW, close enough to the strike of the vertical plane across which maximum right-lateral shear accumulates to almost wholly accommodate that accumulation of both strain and rotation by right-lateral slip. North of the Garlock fault dip slip as well as strike slip on the principal faults (strike similar to N20 degreesW) is required to accommodate the simple shear accumulation. In both cases the accumulated rotation is released with the shear strain. The Garlock fault, which transects the ECSZ, is not offset by north-northwest striking faults nor, despite geological evidence for long-term left-lateral slip, does it appear at the present time to be accumulating left-lateral simple shear strain across the fault due to slip at depth. Rather the motion is explained by right-lateral simple shear across the orthogonal ECSZ. Left-lateral slip on the Garlock fault will release the shear strain accumulating there but would augment the accumulating, rotation, resulting in a secular clockwise rotation rate similar to 80 nrad yr(-1) (4.6 degrees Myr(-1)).},

In the summer of 1999, a cluster of seven sites briefly reversed their direction of motion. No seismicity was associated with this event. The sudden displacements are best explained by approximately 2 centimeters of aseismic slip over a 50-kilometer-by-300-kilometer area on the subduction interface downdip from the seismogenic zone, a rupture equivalent to an earthquake of moment magnitude 6.7. This provides evidence that slip of the hotter, plastic part of the subduction interface, and hence stress loading of the megathrust earthquake zone, can occur in discrete pulses.},

abstract = {Geodesy, the oldest science, has become an important discipline in the geosciences, in large part by enhancing Global Positioning System (GPS) capabilities over the last 35 years well beyond the satellite constellation's original design. The ability of GPS geodesy to estimate 3D positions with millimeter-level precision with respect to a global terrestrial reference frame has contributed to significant advances in geophysics, seismology, atmospheric science, hydrology, and natural hazard science. Monitoring the changes in the positions or trajectories of GPS instruments on the Earth's land and water surfaces, in the atmosphere, or in space, is important for both theory and applications, from an improved understanding of tectonic and magmatic processes to developing systems for mitigating the impact of natural hazards on society and the environment. Besides accurate positioning, all disturbances in the propagation of the transmitted GPS radio signals from satellite to receiver are mined for information, from troposphere and ionosphere delays for weather, climate, and natural hazard applications, to disturbances in the signals due to multipath reflections from the solid ground, water, and ice for environmental applications. We review the relevant concepts of geodetic theory, data analysis, and physical modeling for a myriad of processes at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and discuss the extensive global infrastructure that has been built to support GPS geodesy consisting of thousands of continuously operating stations. We also discuss the integration of heterogeneous and complementary data sets from geodesy, seismology, and geology, focusing on crustal deformation applications and early warning systems for natural hazards.},

abstract = {We present a unified continuum mechanics representation of the mechanisms believed to be commonly involved in post-seismic transients such as viscoelasticity, fault creep and poroelas- ticity. The time-dependent relaxation that follows an earthquake, or any other static stress per- turbation, is considered in a framework of a generalized viscoelastoplastic rheology whereby some inelastic strain relaxes a physical quantity in the material. The relaxed quantity is the deviatoric stress in case of viscoelastic relaxation, the shear stress in case of creep on a fault plane and the trace of the stress tensor in case of poroelastic rebound. In this framework, the instantaneous velocity field satisfies the linear inhomogeneous Navier's equation with sources parametrized as equivalent body forces and surface tractions. We evaluate the velocity field using the Fourier-domain Green's function for an elastic half-space with surface buoyancy boundary condition. The accuracy of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparisons with finite-element simulations of viscoelastic relaxation following strike-slip and dip-slip ruptures for linear and power-law rheologies.We also present comparisons with analytic solu- tions for afterslip driven by coseismic stress changes. Finally,we demonstrate that the proposed method can be used to model time-dependent poroelastic rebound by adopting a viscoelastic rheology with bulk viscosity and work hardening. The proposed method allows one to model post-seismic transients that involve multiple mechanisms (afterslip, poroelastic rebound, duc- tile flow) with an account for the effects of gravity, non-linear rheologies and arbitrary spatial variations in inelastic properties of rocks (e.g. the effective viscosity, rate-and-state frictional parameters and poroelastic properties).},

@article{Simpson2006,
abstract = {In map view, aftershocks of the 2004 Parkfield earthquake lie along a line that forms a straighter connection between San Andreas fault segments north and south of the Parkfield reach than does the mapped trace of the fault itself. A straightedge laid on a geologic map of Central California reveals a [{\~{}}]50-km-long asymmetric northeastward warp in the Parkfield reach of the fault. The warp tapers gradually as it joins the straight, creeping segment of the San Andreas to the northwest, but bends abruptly across Cholame Valley at its southeast end to join the straight, locked segment that last ruptured in 1857. We speculate that the San Andreas fault surface near Parkfield has been deflected in its upper [{\~{}}]6 km by nonelastic behavior of upper crustal rock units. These units and the fault surface itself are warped during periods between large 1857-type earthquakes by the presence of the 1857-locked segment to the south, which buttresses intermittent coseismic and continuous aseismic slip on the Parkfield reach. Because of nonelastic behavior, the warping is not completely undone when an 1857-type event occurs, and the upper portion of the three-dimensional fault surface is slowly ratcheted into an increasingly prominent bulge. Ultimately, the fault surface probably becomes too deformed for strike-slip motion, and a new, more vertical connection to the Earth's surface takes over, perhaps along the Southwest Fracture Zone. When this happens a wedge of material currently west of the main trace will be stranded on the east side of the new main trace.},

abstract = {In 1993 several baselines of the two-color electronic distance meter (EDM) network at Parkfield, California, deviated from their long-term rates, coincident with anomalous observations from nearby strain meters and a creep meter, as well as an increase in microseismicity. Between October 1992 and December 1994, three M ∼ 4.5 earthquakes occurred beneath Middle Mountain, near the hypocenter of the 1934 and 1966 Parkfield M6 events. We analyzed the two-color EDM data using a Kalman-filtering based technique to image the spatiotemporal evolution of slip on the fault at Parkfield between the mid-1980s and 2003. This method accounts for localized random walk motion of the geodetic monuments and a prominent seasonal signal that affects many baselines. We find that a slip rate increase occurred between January 1993 and July 1996 on the upper 8 km of the fault near Middle Mountain. The peak estimated slip rate during this time was 49 mm/yr, which exceeds the long-term geologic rate of ∼35 mm/yr. The slip rate evolution appears episodic, with an initial modest increase after the M4.3 earthquake and a much larger jump following the shallower M4.7 event in December 1994. This temporal correlation between inferred slip and seismicity suggests that the moderate earthquakes triggered the aseismic fault slip. The EDM data cannot resolve whether transient slip propagated across the nucleation zone of the 1934 and 1966 M6 Parkfield earthquakes. However, transient slip and its associated stress release in the hypocentral area of previous Parkfield events is consistent with the nucleation of the 2004 M6 Parkfield earthquake elsewhere on the fault.},

This balance, in the region of the Tibetan plateau, yields an estimate of 1022 pascal second for the average viscosity of the Tibetan lithosphere, which is only about 10 to 100 times greater than the viscosity of the convecting upper mantle.},

abstract = {Modern geodetic techniques, such as the global positioning system (GPS) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), provide high-precision deformation measurements of earthquakes. Through elastic models and mathematical optimization methods, the observations can be related to a slip distribution model. The classic linear, kinematic, and static slip inversion problem requires specification of a smoothing norm of slip parameters and a residual norm of the data and a choice about the relative weight between the two norms. Inversions for unknown fault geometry are nonlinear and, therefore, the fault geometry is often assumed to be known for the slip inversion problem. We present a new method to invert simultaneously for fault slip and fault geometry assuming a uniform stress drop over the slipping area of the fault. The method uses a full Bayesian inference method as an engine to estimate the posterior probability distribution of stress drop, fault geometry parameters, and fault slip. We validate the method with a synthetic data set and apply the method to InSAR observations of a moderate-sized normal faulting event, the 6 October 2008 Mw 6.3 Dangxiong-Yangyi (Tibet) earthquake. The results show a 45.0 ± 0.2° west dipping fault with a maximum net slip of ∼1.13 m, and the static stress drop and rake angle are estimated as ∼5.43 MPa and ∼92.5°, respectively. The stress drop estimate falls within the typical range of earthquake stress drops known from previous studies.},

The block model allows us to estimate internally consistent fault slip rates and locking depths. The northern strand of the North Anatolian fault zone (NAFZ) carries approximately four times as much right-lateral motion (?24 mm/yr) as does the southern strand. In the Marmara Sea region, the data show strain accu- mulation to be highly localized. We find that a straight fault geometry with a shallow locking depth of 6–7 km fits the observed Global Positioning System velocities better than does a stepped fault geometry that follows the northern and eastern edges of the sea. This shallow locking depth suggests that the moment release associated with an earthquake on these faults should be smaller, by a factor of 2.3, than previously inferred assuming a locking depth of 15 km.},

abstract = {1 Perfettini and Avouac 2004) postulated that both the aftershock rate assumed proportional to the local stressing rate) and the postseismic relaxation are driven by the loading imposed by postseismic slip on the brittle creep fault zone (BCFZ), the downdip extension of the fault zone below the coseismic rupture. I explore the consequences of that hypothesis for a long, strike-slip fault in the case where the BCFZ rheology is compatible with ordinary transient creep creep strain proportional to log(e)(1+t/tau(2))). Because the important relaxation occurs near the bottom of the coseismic rupture, I calculate the postearthquake response with a model in which the BCFZ is represented by a viscoelastic half-space below the coseismic rupture. I find that both the predicted postseismic relaxation and the cumulative number of aftershocks can be approximated by the same temporal dependence N-MO( t) = a(MO)(1-(1 + t/tau)(1-p))/( p - 1), where t is the time after the earthquake and aMO, t, and p are the constants chosen to fit either data set. Notice that dN(MO)( t)/dt = (a(MO)/tau)/(1 + t/tau)(p) is the modified Omori law used to describe the rate of aftershock occurrence. Thus, the modified Omori law can be understood as a consequence of the Perfettini - Avouac hypothesis aftershocks driven by slip on the BCFZ) and a BCFZ rheology compatible with ordinary transient creep. Moreover, the temporal dependence NMO( t) has been shown to fit postseismic surface deformation following at least 9 earthquakes. I also show that the conventional, one-dimensional, spring-block model of a BFCZ with a rheology compatible with ordinary transient creep leads to the same temporal dependence (N-MO( t)).},

abstract = {Measurements of tectonic deformation depend on both accurate instrumentation and adequate coupling of the apparatus to the earth's crust. Existing techniques, capable of resolving the signals of interest (strain rates of 10 n∈/yr), are mainly observatory based. The limitation in the baselength of these instruments (∼1 km) results in a requirement that the reference monuments be exceptionally stable (10 $\mu$m/yr). However, records from Pi{\~{n}}on Flat Observatory, California, show that the actual horizontal displacements for massive near surface monuments, emplaced in competent, weathered granite, are of the order of 50 $\mu$m/yr. The low noise level of the strain measurements at this site indicates that this magnitude of monument displacement is abnormally small. Until high-accuracy geodetic techniques are developed, sophisticated monuments (or monument monitoring devices) will be necessary to record faithfully continuous crustal deformation.},

Previously unidentified bench mark instability biases portions of tidal records by about 1.6 mm a-1 before correction. We determine precise relative uplift rates at the six tidal sites with an adjustment that includes rates of differenced time series as additional constraints. Our analysis of National Geodetic Survey leveling data between tide gauges corrects errors in 1941 leveling, and 184 secondary ties double the number of highest quality uplift rate estimates. Relative uplift rates from leveling are adjusted to the tidal rates, accounting for uncertainties in both data types. Tidal and leveling uplift rates agree within error for all but one of the coastal segments, where we infer systematic leveling error affects the 1988 line. Uplift rates are made absolute using an interval and location-specific geocentric sea level rise rate of 2.3 ± 0.2 mm a-1. Total propagated one sigma errors for the absolute uplift rates of bench marks are about 0.4 mm a-1. Along-strike changes in uplift rate near 45degN and 42.8degN require two distinct changes in locking depth, as inferred from elastic dislocation modeling. The along-strike changes in locking on this portion of the Cascadia subduction zone interface correlate to the western and southern extent of the mafic Siletzia block in the fore arc.},

abstract = {[1] We estimate slip rates on major active faults in southern California using a block model constrained by Global Positioning System measurements of interseismic deformation. The block model includes the effects of block rotation and elastic strain accumulation consistent with a simple model of the earthquake cycle. Our estimates of the right-lateral strike-slip rate on the San Andreas fault vary by at least a factor of 5, from a high of 35.9 +/- 0.5 mm/yr in the Carrizo Plain to a low of 5.1 +/- 1.5 mm/yr through the San Bernadino segment. Shortening across the Puente Hills Thrust and left-lateral slip on the Raymond Hill fault are consistent with both thickening and escape tectonics in the Los Angeles Basin. Discrepancies between geodetic and geologic slip rate estimates along the San Andreas and San Jacinto faults, as well as in the Eastern California Shear Zone, may be explained by a temporal change in fault system behavior. We find no substantial evidence for long-term postseismic relaxation and infer that the viscosity of the lower crust/upper mantle may be relatively high (eta {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} 10(19) Pa s).},

In this paper we introduce a semianalytic three-dimensional (3-D) linear viscoelastic Maxwell model that is developed in the Fourier domain to exploit the computational advantages of the convolution theorem. A new aspect of this model is an analytic solution for the surface loading of an elastic plate overlying a viscoelastic half-space. When fully implemented, the model simulates ( 1) interseismic stress accumulation on the upper locked portion of faults, ( 2) repeated earthquakes on prescribed fault segments, and ( 3) the viscoelastic response of the asthenosphere beneath the plate following episodic ruptures. We verify both the analytic solution and computer code through a variety of 2-D and 3-D tests and examples. On the basis of the methodology presented here, it is now possible to explore thousands of years of the earthquake cycle along geometrically complex 3-D fault systems.},

abstract = {Postseismic deformation due to the 1992 Mw7.3 Landers, southern California, earthquake is investigated using the entire catalog of the ERS synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, and GPS measurements made between 1992 and 1999. The stacked interferometric SAR (InSAR) data spanning the time period of 7 years between the Landers and the Hector Mine earthquakes reveal a transient postseismic deformation with a characteristic decay time of several years. The horizontal displacements measured with GPS exhibit somewhat smaller decay times of 1–2 years. I use a slip model of the Landers earthquake that fits all available geodetic data [Fialko, 2004] to calculate and compare permanent postseismic displacements due to viscoelastic and poroelastic relaxation. Viscoelastic models assuming weak mantle or lower crust do not agree with the InSAR data in the limit of complete relaxation, implying large ({\textgreater}10 years) relaxation times, essentially nonlinear rheology, or an appreciable yield strength of the lower lithosphere. A combination of poroelastic relaxation above the brittle-ductile transition and localized shear deformation on and below the Landers rupture is able to explain most of the available geodetic data. The InSAR data suggest that pore fluids and interconnected pore space are ubiquitously present throughout the seismogenic layer up to depth of 15 km or greater. The effective hydraulic diffusivity of the upper crust inferred from the kinetics of surface deformation is of the order of 0.1–1 m2/s, consistent with the laboratory, field, and deep borehole measurements. The post-Landers geodetic data suggest that discrete narrow fault zones extend into the lower crust and perhaps the uppermost mantle, thus lending support to a ‘‘block tectonics'' model of the Eastern California Shear Zone.},

abstract = {We measure ground motion around the Lake Mead, Nevada, using synthetic aperture radar interferometry. The lake water level has fluctuated through time since impoundment in 1935. To quantify the deformation due to water level variations over the past decade, and to constrain the crust and mantle rheological parameters in the lake area, we analyze 241 interferograms based on 43 ERS images acquired between 1992 and 2002. All interferograms have a high coherence due to arid conditions. Most of them show strong atmospheric artefacts. Tropospheric phase delays are estimated and corrected for each interferogram by analyzing the phase/elevation correlation. Corrections are validated using data from the ERA40 global atmospheric reanalysis. Corrected interferograms are inverted pixel by pixel to solve for the time series of ground motion in the lake area. Temporal smoothing is added to reduce random atmospheric artefacts. The observed deformation is nonlinear in time and spreads over a 50 50 km2 area. We observe a 16 mm subsidence between 1995 and 1998 due to an 11 m water level increase, followed by an uplift due to the water level drop after 2000. We model the deformation, taking into account the loading history of the lake since 1935. A simple elastic model with parameters constrained by seismic wave velocities does not explain the amplitude of the observed motion. The two-layer viscoelastic model proposed by Kaufmann and Amelung (2000), with a mantle viscosity of 1018 Pa s, adjusts well the data amplitude and its spatiotemporal shape.},

abstract = {The Laguna Salada rift basin is within the zone of shearing between the Pacific and North American plates and is an asymmetric half-graben controlled on its eastern margin by the Laguna Salada fault and the Ca{\~{n}}ada David detachment. Both faults dip west, have accommodated {\textgreater}10 km of offset since the middle-late Miocene, and are associated with an extensive late Quaternary fault array. The Laguna Salada fault is a high-angle fault that strikes northwest and has an oblique normal-dextral sense of shear. The Ca{\~{n}}ada David detachment is a low-angle normal fault with a curvilinear trace that extends {\~{}}55 60 km and contains two prominent megamullion antiform-synform pairs. The late Quaternary scarp array that extends along the entire mountain front shows remarkable variations with antiformal and synformal megamullions. In antiformal domains, the scarp array is generally wider, closer to the mountain front ({\textless}100 m), and contains numerous antithetic scarps. In synformal domains, it is well removed from the mountain front (3.5 10 km) and contains more synthetic scarps. Integrated deformation across the array shows a systematic decrease in the ratio of horizontal:vertical deformation with distance from the Ca{\~{n}}ada David detachment, which reflects the mechanism of accommodation of the horizontal component of slip, and/or is the direct result of a master fault with a near-surface antilistric geometry. Patterns of sedimentation as well as gravity and seismic data are consistent with the latter and strongly suggest that the Ca{\~{n}}ada David detachment takes on a high-angle geometry within 5 10 km of the mountain front. Structural analysis of the scarps and range-bounding fault clearly demonstrates a basin-ward migration of deformation at a variety of scales along the Ca{\~{n}}ada David detachment. The largest steps (3.5 10 km) in this migration are made in synformal megamullion domains, where the strong divergence of the scarp array from the trace of the Ca{\~{n}}ada David detachment results in the abandonment of large segments of the detachment and the transfer of large lozenge-shaped tectonic blocks from the hanging wall to the footwall. The basinward migration of deformation and inferred near-surface antilistric geometry are both defining characteristics of the rolling-hinge model of normal faulting. If this model is applicable, our data indicate that the near-surface antilistric bend of the master fault is tighter and more abrupt than previously envisioned.},

At Pinon Flat Observatory, data indicate a constant shear strain accumulation of 0.6 microstrain per annum with the axis of maximum compression oriented 50° ± 5° west of north. This result differs significantly from regional geodetic estimates, the amplitude being dominated by continued viscoelastic response of the hole. Variations of measured strain rate exceeding 100 nstrain/yr would be significant at this instrument site. At San Juan Bautista, measurements of the angle of maximum compression (10° ± 3° west of north) agree closely with previous geodetic and hydrofracture estimates. After 2 years of operation the residual shear strain rate is 1 $\mu$strain/yr. Preliminary analysis of strain steps observed at San Juan Bautista during the Morgan Hill earthquake of April 24, 1984, show good agreement with calculations from seismically determined source parameters for this event.},

The relation between log S and log Mo is remarkably linear (slope ∼ 2/3) indicating a constant stress drop $\Delta$$\sigma$; $\Delta$$\sigma$ = 30, 100 and 60 bars are obtained for inter-plate, intra-plate and “average” earthquakes, respectively. Except for very large earthquakes, the relation MS ∼ (2/3) log Mo ∼ 2 log L is established by the data. This is consistent with the dynamic dislocation model for point dislocation rise times and rupture times of most earthquakes. For very large earthquakes MS ∼ (1/3) log Mo ∼ log L ∼ (1/3) log ES. For very small earthquakes MS ∼ log Mo ∼ 3 log L ∼ log ES. Scaling rules are assumed and justified. This model predicts log ES ∼ 1.5 MS ∼ 3 log L which is consistent with the Gutenberg-Richter relation. Since the static energy is proportional to $\sigma$̅L3, where $\sigma$̅ is the average stress, this relation suggests a constant apparent stress $\eta$$\sigma$̅ where $\eta$ is the efficiency. The earthquake data suggest $\eta$$\sigma$̅{\~{}}0.5 $\Delta$$\sigma$. These relations lead to log S ∼ MS consistent with the empirical relation. This relation together with a simple geometrical argument explains the magnitude-frequency relation log N ∼ − MS.},

abstract = {Obtaining high-quality measurements close to a large earthquake is not easy: one has to be in the right place at the right time with the right instruments. Such a convergence happened, for the first time, when the 28 September 2004 Parkfield, California, earthquake occurred on the San Andreas fault in the middle of a dense network of instruments designed to record it. The resulting data reveal aspects of the earthquake process never before seen. Here we show what these data, when combined with data from earlier Parkfield earthquakes, tell us about earthquake physics and earthquake prediction. The 2004 Parkfield earthquake, with its lack of obvious precursors, demonstrates that reliable short-term earthquake prediction still is not achievable. To reduce the societal impact of earthquakes now, we should focus on developing the next generation of models that can provide better predictions of the strength and location of damaging ground shaking.},

abstract = {We investigate the spatiotemporal variation of fault slip on the subduction interface in southwest Japan following the two 1996 Hyuganada earthquakes (M 6.7) using continuous GPS observations. A silent thrust slip event has been reported by Hirose et al. [1999] , following these earthquakes approximately 100 km to the north beneath the Bungo channel. We employ the Network Inversion Filter to rigorously invert for the fault slip distribution in space and time. The GPS time series is modeled as a sum of: (1) secular deformation; (2) coseismic station displacements; (3) transient fault slip; (4) random benchmark motion; (5) reference frame shifts; and (6) observational errors. Nonnegativity constraints effectively prohibit normal faulting on the subduction interface. Spatial and temporal smoothing parameters are estimated by the extended Kalman filter. The estimated fault slip-rate images postseismic slip following the two Hyuganada earthquakes. Slip associated with the silent thrust event began roughly 1 month after the second earthquake but initiated ∼100 km to the northeast of the Hyuganada earthquakes. The slow event propagated southwest and downdip beneath the Bungo channel, lasting approximately 1 year with maximum slip-rates of 0.6 m/yr. The equivalent seismic moment was MW ∼ 7.2. We can rule out the possibility that slip propagated from the source region of the Hyuganada earthquakes to the location of the silent earthquake. However, the timing of the events suggests a causal connection, perhaps due to static stress transfer. This kind of transient event, or silent earthquake, may reflect different fault zone characteristics and may be responsible for accommodating strain that would otherwise be released in large earthquakes.},

The observations consist of repeated GPS measurements of the position of one monument relative to another (separation similar to 100 km). The early observations (t {\textless} 0.1 year) are well fit by the function a ' + c ' log(t), where t is the time after the earthquake and a ' and c ' are constants chosen to fit the data. Because a log(t) time dependence is characteristic of transient (primary) creep, the early postseismic response may be governed by transient creep as Benioff proposed in 1951. That inference is provisional as the stress conditions prevailing in postseismic relaxation are not identical to the constant stress condition in creep experiments. The observed logarithmic time dependence includes no characteristic time that might aid in identifying the micromechanical cause.},

abstract = {We investigate properties of earthquake stress drops in simulations of evolving seismicity and stress field on a heterogeneous fault. The model consists of an inherently discrete strike-slip fault surrounded by a 3D elastic half-space. We consider various spatial distributions of frictional properties and analyze results generated by 150-300 model years. In all cases, the self-organized heterogeneous initial stress distributions at the times of earthquake failure lead to stress drops that are systematically lower than those predicted for a homogeneous process. In particular, the large system-sized events have stress drops that are consistently similar to 25{\%} of predictions based on the average fault strength. The type and amount of assumed spatial heterogeneity on the fault affect the stress-drop statistics of small earthquakes (M-L {\textless} 5) more than those of the larger events. This produces a decrease in the range of stress drops as the earthquake magnitudes increase. The results can resolve the discrepancy between traditional estimates of stress drops and seismological observations. The general tendency for low stress drops of large events provides a rationale for reducing the statistical estimates of potential ground motion associated with large earthquakes.},

Many major faults, including the San Andreas Fault, are weak compared with the surrounding rock, but the cause of this weakness is debated 1 . Previous measurements of the frictional strength of San Andreas Fault rocks are too high to explain the observed weakness 1,913 . However, these measurements relied on samples taken at a distance from the active fault or from weathered surface samples. Recent drilling into the San Andreas Fault 9 has provided material from the actively slipping fault at seismogenic depths. Here we present systematic measurements of the frictional properties and composition of the San Andreas Fault at 2.7 km depth, including the wall rock and active fault. We ﬁnd that the fault is weak relative to the surrounding rock and that the fault rock exhibits stable sliding friction behaviour. The fault zone contains the weak mineral smectite and exhibits no frictional healingbonds in the material do not heal after rupture. Taken together, the low inherent strength and lack of healing of the fault-zone material could explain why the San Andreas Fault slips by aseismic creep and small earthquakes in central California, rather than by large, destructive earthquakes.},

abstract = {During the first 2 years following the 2002 Mw = 7.9 Denali, Alaska, strike-slip earthquake, a large array of Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers recorded rapid postseismic surface motions extending at least 300 km from the rupture and at rates of more than 100 mm/yr in the near field. Here we use three-dimensional (3-D) viscoelastic finite element models to infer the mechanisms responsible for these postseismic observations. We consider afterslip both from an inversion of GPS displacements and from stress-driven forward models, poroelastic rebound, and viscoelastic flow in the lower crust and upper mantle. Several conclusions can be drawn: (1) No single mechanism can explain the postseismic observations. (2) Significant postseismic flow below a depth of 60 km is required to explain observed far-field motions, best explained by a weak upper mantle with a depth-dependent effective viscosity that ranges from {\textgreater}1019 Pa s at the Moho (50 km depth) to 3–4 × 1018 Pa s at 100 km depth. (3) Shallow afterslip within the upper crust occurs adjacent to and beneath the regions of largest coseismic slip. (4) There is a contribution from deformation in the middle and lower crust from either lower crustal flow or stress-driven slip. Afterslip is preferred over broad viscoelastic flow owing to the existence of seismic velocity discontinuities across the fault at depth, though our modeling does not favor either mechanism. If the process is viscoelastic relaxation, the viscosity is a factor of 3 greater than the inferred mantle viscosity. (5) Poroelastic rebound probably contributed to the observed postseismic deformation in the immediate vicinity of the Denali/Totschunda junction. These conclusions lead us to infer an Alaskan mechanical lithosphere that is about 60 km thick, overlying a weak asthenosphere, and a Denali fault that cuts through the entire lithosphere with shear accommodated by faulting in the top ∼20 km and time-dependent aseismic shear below.},

The main task is to remove undesirable noise and uneven edges while retaining desirable geometric features.

Our approach contains three novel features: an implicit integra- tion method to achieve efficiency, stability, and large time-steps; a scale-dependent Laplacian operator to improve the diffusion pro- cess; and finally, a robust curvature flow operator that achieves a smoothing of the shape itself, distinct from any parameterization. Additional features of the algorithm include automatic exact vol- ume preservation, and hard and soft constraints on the positions of the points in the mesh. We compare our method to previous operators and related algo- rithms, and prove that our curvature and Laplacian operators have several mathematically-desirable qualities that improve the appear- ance of the resulting surface. In consequence, the user can easily select the appropriate operator according to the desired type of fair- ing.

abstract = {Displacement on intracontinental transforms is commonly distributed over a zone several hundred km wide, and may incorporate large regions of transtensional and transpressional strain, but no consensus exists on what controls the distribution and style of this deformation. We model the transform boundary as a weak shear zone of finite length that exerts shear stress on the deformable continental lithosphere on either side. Strain-rate decreases away from the shear zone on a scale related to its length. Force balance in this system requires lateral gradients in shear strain-rate to be balanced by longitudinal gradients in stretching rates, which create zones of lithospheric thickening and thinning distributed anti-symmetrically about the shear zone. Simple analytical estimates, two-dimensional (2D) spectral models, and 2D/3D numerical models are employed to study the spatial scales and magnitudes of the zones of uplift and subsidence. Using reasonable parameter values, the models yield geologically relevant rates. Strain-rate components inferred from the GPS-determined 2-D velocity field, and analysis of seismicity using Kostrov's method, taken together with the geological data on the distribution of active faults, uplift, and subsidence, suggest that the distribution and rates of active deformation in California are consistent with our predictions. This validates the assumptions of the continuum approach, and provides a tool for predicting and explaining the tectonics of California and of other intracontinental transform systems. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {[1] Perfettini et al. (2005) suggested that the temporal dependence of surface displacements u( t) measured in the epicentral area following an earthquake is related to N( t), the cumulative number of aftershocks, by the equation u( t) = a + bt + cN( t) + d(1 - e (-alpha t)), where a, b, c, d, and alpha are constants chosen to fit the data and t is the postearthquake time. N( t) appears in the expression for u( t) because both the aftershocks and a portion of u( t) are thought to be driven by the same source, postseismic fault creep at subseismogenic depths on the downdip extension of the coseismic rupture. We show that this equation with the actually observed N( t) fits the postseismic displacements recorded on several baselines following each of five earthquakes: 1999 M7.6 Chi-Chi ( Taiwan), 1999 M7.1 Hector Mine ( southern California), 2002 M7.9 Denali ( central Alaska), 2003 M6.5 San Simeon ( central California), and 2004 M6.0 Parkfield ( central California) earthquakes. Although there are plausible physical interpretations for each of the terms in the expression for u( t), the large number of adjustable constants ( a, b, c, d, and a) involved in fitting the rather simple postseismic displacements diminishes the significance of the fit. Because the observed N( t) is well fit by the modified Omori's law, fault creep at depth presumably exhibits the same temporal dependence. That dependence could be explained if the rheology of the fault downdip from the coseismic rupture is consistent with ordinary transient creep. Montesi ( 2004) demonstrated that power law creep across a shear zone at depth would also produce that temporal signal.},

abstract = {We estimate the rate of aftershocks triggered by a heterogeneous stress change, using the rate-and-state model of Dieterich [1994].We show that an exponential stress distribution Pt(au) {\~{}}exp(-tautau{\_}0) gives an Omori law decay of aftershocks with time {\~{}}1/t{\^{}}p, with an exponent p=1-A sigma{\_}n/tau{\_}0, where A is a parameter of the rate-and-state friction law, and $\backslash$sigma{\_}n the normal stress. Omori exponent p thus decreases if the stress "heterogeneity" tau{\_}0 decreases. We also invert the stress distribution P(tau) from the seismicity rate R(t), assuming that the stress does not change with time. We apply this method to a synthetic stress map, using the (modified) scale invariant "k{\^{}}2" slip model [Herrero and Bernard, 1994]. We generate synthetic aftershock catalogs from this stress change.The seismicity rate on the rupture area shows a huge increase at short times, even if the stress decreases on average. Aftershocks are clustered in the regions of low slip, but the spatial distribution is more diffuse than for a simple slip dislocation. Because the stress field is very heterogeneous, there are many patches of positive stress changes everywhere on the fault.This stochastic slip model gives a Gaussian stress distribution, but nevertheless produces an aftershock rate which is very close to Omori's law, with an effective p{\textless}=1, which increases slowly with time. We obtain a good estimation of the stress distribution for realistic catalogs, when we constrain the shape of the distribution. However, there are probably other factors which also affect the temporal decay of aftershocks with time. In particular, heterogeneity of A$\backslash$sigma{\_}n can also modify the parameters p and c of Omori's law. Finally, we show that stress shadows are very difficult to observe in a heterogeneous stress context.},

With an accurate function of postseismic response, the coseismic displacements can be estimated from the high-rate, 1-min sampling GPS; and the coseismic displacements are approximately 75{\%} of those estimated from the daily solutions. Consequently, fault-slip models using daily solutions overestimate coseismic slip. In addition, at 2 months and at 8 months following the mainshock, postseismic displacements are modeled as slip on the San Andreas fault with a lower bound on the moment exceeding that of the coseismic moment.

abstract = {In inversion of geodetic data for spatial distribution of fault slip under smoothing and positivity constraints, subjective or incorrect techniques are often employed to select a smoothing parameter that determines the relative weight placed on fitting the data versus smoothing the slip distribution. A popular objective method based on Akaike's Bayesian information criterion (ABIC) is incorrect if positivity constraints are employed. We introduce a fully probabilistic inversion method to simultaneously estimate the slip distribution and smoothing parameter objectively and correctly in a Bayesian framework. The complete solution to the inverse problem, the joint posterior probability density function of slip and smoothing parameter, is formulated using Bayes' theorem and sampled with a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We apply the new method to coseismic displacement data from the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan, earthquake and compare the results of our method with conventional methods. The slip distribution estimated with our method is significantly smoother than that estimated by the ABIC-based method, demonstrating that the ABIC-based method may in general generate significantly undersmoothed or oversmoothed slip distributions under positivity constraints. On the other hand, the estimated slip distribution is similar to that estimated using another conventional method based on cross validation. Multiple trade-off curve plots between slip roughness and data misfit show that trade-off curves provide no basis for selecting a single smoothing parameter. The new method is easily generalized to slip inversions of multiple data sets with unknown relative weighting and to slip inversions with unknown fault geometry parameters.},

Here we augment this GPS data with interferometric synthetic aperture radar imagery to take into account the deformation associated with groundwater pumping and strike-slip faulting. After removing these non-tectonic signals, we are left with 4.4 mm yr-1 of uniaxial contraction across the Los Angeles basin, oriented N 36 degrees E (perpendicular to the major strike-slip faults in the area). This indicates that the contraction is primarily accommodated on thrust faults rather than on the northeast-trending strike-slip faults. We have found that widespread groundwater and oil pumping obscures and in some cases mimics the tectonic signals expected from the blind thrust faults. In the 40-km-long Santa Ana basin, groundwater withdrawal and re-injection produces 12 mm yr-1 of long-term subsidence, accompanied by an unprecedented seasonal oscillation of 55 mm in the vertical direction and 7 mm horizontally.},

abstract = {We analyzed aftershocks and postseismic deformation recorded by the continuous GPS station AREQ following the M-w = 8.4, 23 June 2001 Peru earthquake. This station moved by 50 cm trenchward, in a N235 degrees E direction during the coseismic phase, and continued to move in the same direction for an additional 15 cm over the next 2 years. We compare observations with the prediction of a simple one-dimensional (1-D) system of springs, sliders, and dashpot loaded by a constant force, meant to simulate stress transfer during the seismic cycle. The model incorporates a seismogenic fault zone, obeying rate-weakening friction, a zone of deep afterslip, the brittle creep fault zone (BCFZ) obeying rate-strengthening friction, and a zone of viscous flow at depth, the ductile fault zone (DFZ). This simple model captures the main features of the temporal evolution of seismicity and deformation. Our results imply that crustal strain associated with stress accumulation during the interseismic period is probably not stationary over most of the interseismic period. The BCFZ appears to control the early postseismic response ( afterslip and aftershocks), although an immediate increase, by a factor of about 1.77, of ductile shear rate is required, placing constraints on the effective viscosity of the DFZ. Following a large subduction earthquake, displacement of inland sites is trenchward in the early phase of the seismic cycle and reverse to landward after a time t(i) for which an analytical expression is given. This study adds support to the view that the decay rate of aftershocks may be controlled by reloading due to deep afterslip. Given the ratio of preseismic to postseismic viscous creep, we deduce that frictional stresses along the subduction interface account for probably 70{\%} of the force transmitted along the plate interface.},

The system strikes northwest and is composed of at least seven major faults linked by numerous smaller faults, making this one of the most complex surface ruptures ever documented along the Pacifi c–North America plate boundary. Rup- ture propagated bilaterally through three distinct kinematic and geomorphic domains. Southeast of the epicenter, a broad region of distributed fracturing, liquefaction, and dis- continuous fault rupture was controlled by a buried, southwest-dipping, dextral-normal fault system that extends {\~{}}53 km across the southern Colorado River delta. Northwest of the epicenter, the sense of vertical slip as rupture propagated through mul- tiple strands of an imbricate stack of east- dipping dextral-normal faults that extend {\~{}}55 km through the Sierra Cucapah. How- ever, some coseismic slip (10–30 cm) was partitioned onto the west-dipping Laguna Salada fault, which extends parallel to the main rupture and defi nes the western margin of the Sierra Cucapah. In the northernmost domain, rupture terminates on a series of several north-northeast–striking cross-faults with minor offset ({\textless}8 cm) that cut uplifted and folded sediments of the northern Colo- rado River delta in the Yuha Desert. In the Sierra Cucapah, primary rupture occurred on four major faults separated by one fault branch and two accommodation zones. The accommodation zones are distrib- uted in a left-stepping en echelon geometry, such that rupture passed systematically to structurally lower faults. The structurally lowest fault that ruptured in this event is inclined as shallowly as {\~{}}20°. Net surface off- sets in the Sierra Cucapah average {\~{}}200 cm, with some reaching 300–400 cm, and rup- ture kinematics vary greatly along strike. Nonetheless, instantaneous extension direc- tions are consistently oriented {\~{}}085° and the dominant slip direction is {\~{}}310°, which is slightly ({\~{}}10°) more westerly than the expected azimuth of relative plate motion, but considerably more oblique to other nearby historical ruptures such as the 1992 Landers earthquake. Complex multifault ruptures are common in the central portion of the Pacifi c North American plate margin, which is affected by restraining bend tecton- ics, gravitational potential energy gradients, and the inherently three-dimensional strain of the transtensional and transpressional shear regimes that operate in this region.},

abstract = {We have developed a kinematic fault network model of crustal deformation in an elastic half-space. Surface deformation is calculated using this model assuming each fault segment slipping beneath a locking depth. Each fault segment connects to its adjacent elements with slip vector continuity imposed at fault nodes or intersections; the degree of the constraints determines whether deformation is block-like or not. We apply this model to invert GPS observations for slip rates on major faults in California with geological rate constraints. Based on the F-test result, we find that lesser block-like models fit the data significantly better than the strictly block-like model. Our final inversion shows a slip rate varying from 20 to 23. mm/yr along the northern San Andreas from the Santa Cruz to the North Coast segment. Slip rates vary from 9 to 13. mm/yr along the Hayward to the Maacama fault segment, and from 15 to 3. mm/yr along the central Calaveras to the West Napa fault segment. For the central California Creeping Zone, the result suggests a depth dependent creep rate with an average of 22. mm/yr over the top 5. km and 32. mm/yr underneath. From the Mojave to San Bernardino Mountain segments, we also find a significant decrease in slip rate along the San Andreas in comparison with the geologic rates, in contrast to a significant increase in slip rate on faults along the eastern California shear zone. Along the southern San Andreas, slip rates vary from 21 to 25. mm/yr from the Coachella Valley to Imperial Valley segments. Slip rates range from 0 to 3. mm/yr across the western Transverse Ranges faults, which is consistent with the regional crustal thickening. Overall slip rates derived from geodetic observations correlate strongly with the geologic slip rates statistically, suggesting high compatibility between geodetic and geologic observations. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {An analysis of the first two years of postseismic surface deformations from GPS reveals that afterslip is the only mechanism significantly contributing to postseismic deformation following the 2004 M6 Parkfield, California earthquake. Finite element modeling shows this event to have been too small to significantly stress the lower crust and upper mantle, thus viscoelastic relaxation did not lead to detectable surface displacements. Similarly, coseismically induced pressure changes in the upper crust were not sufficient to induce a measurable poroelastic response. From 10 days to two years after the Parkfield earthquake, postseismic displacements at all GPS stations experience the same characteristic decay time (∼2 weeks). This suggests that only afterslip was activated and the distribution of slip remained unchanged in this time period. Afterslip was found to be broadly distributed in the upper 15 km of the crust and associated with a moment release of much greater magnitude than the coseismic rupture.},

abstract = {The El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake sequence started with a few foreshocks in March 2010, and a second sequence of 15 foreshocks of M{\textgreater}2 (up to M4.4) that occurred during the 24h preceding the mainshock. The foreshocks occurred along a northsouth trend near the mainshock epicenter. The M w 7.2 mainshock on April 4 exhibited complex faulting, possibly starting with a {\~{}}M6 normal faulting event, followed {\~{}}15s later by the main event, which included simultaneous normal and right-lateral strike-slip faulting. The aftershock zone extends for 120km from the south end of the Elsinore fault zone north of the USMexico border almost to the northern tip of the Gulf of California. The waveform-relocated aftershocks form two abutting clusters, each about 50km long, as well as a 10km northsouth aftershock zone just north of the epicenter of the mainshock. Even though the Baja California data are included, the magnitude of completeness and the hypocentral errors increase gradually with distance south of the international border. The spatial distribution of large aftershocks is asymmetric with five M5+ aftershocks located to the south of the mainshock, and only one M5.7 aftershock, but numerous smaller aftershocks to the north. Further, the northwest aftershock cluster exhibits complex faulting on both northwest and northeast planes. Thus, the aftershocks also express a complex pattern of stress release along strike. The overall rate of decay of the aftershocks is similar to the rate of decay of a generic California aftershock sequence. In addition, some triggered seismicity was recorded along the Elsinore and San Jacinto faults to the north, but significant northward migration of aftershocks has not occurred. The synthesis of the El Mayor-Cucapah sequence reveals transtensional regional tectonics, including the westward growth of the Mexicali Valley and the transfer of PacificNorth America plate motion from the Gulf of California in the south into the southernmost San Andreas fault system to the north. We propose that the location of the 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah, as well as the 1992 Landers and 1999 Hector Mine earthquakes, may have been controlled by the bends in the plate boundary.},

Kinematic inversions of postseismic GPS data over a time period of 3 years show that afterslip occurred in areas of low seismicity and low coseismic slip, predominantly at a depth of 5 km. Inversions suggest that coseismic stress increases were relaxed by predominantly aseismic afterslip on a fault plane. The kinetics of afterslip is consistent with a velocity-strengthening friction generalized to include the case of infinitesimal velocities. We performed simulations of stress-driven creep using a numerical model that evaluates the time-dependent deformation due to coseismic stress changes in a viscoelastoplastic half-space. Starting with a coseismic slip distribution, we compute the time-dependent evolution of afterslip on a fault plane and the associated displacements at the GPS stations. Data are best explained by a rate-strengthening model with frictional JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 114, B07405, doi:10.1029/2008JB005748, 2009 parameter (a  b)=7  103, at a high end of values observed in laboratory experiments. We also find that the geodetic moment due to creep is a factor of 100 greater than the cumulative seismic moment of aftershocks. The rate of aftershocks in the top 10 km of the seismogenic zone mirrors the kinetics of afterslip, suggesting that postearthquake seismicity is governed by loading from the nearby aseismic creep. The San Andreas fault around Parkfield is deduced to have large along-strike variations in rate-and-state frictional properties. Velocity strengthening areas may be responsible for the separation of the coseismic slip in two distinct asperities and for the ongoing aseismic creep occurring between the velocity-weakening patches after the 2004 rupture.},

abstract = {The ITRF2008 velocity field is demonstrated to be of higher quality and more precise than past ITRF solutions. We estimated an absolute tectonic plate motion model made up of 14 major plates, using velocities of 206 sites of high geodetic quality (far from plate boundaries, deformation zones and Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) regions), derived from and consistent with ITRF2008. The precision of the estimated model is evaluated to be at the level of 0.3 mm/a WRMS. No GIA corrections were applied to site velocities prior to estimating plate rotation poles, as our selected sites are outside the Fennoscandia regions where the GIA models we tested are performing reasonably well, and far from GIA areas where the models would degrade the fit (Antarctica and North America). Our selected velocity field has small origin rate bias components following the three axis (X, Y, Z), respectively 0.41 ± 0.54, 0.22 ± 0.64 and 0.41 ± 0.60 (95 per cent confidence limits). Comparing our model to NNR-NUVEL-1A and the newly available NNR-MORVEL56, we found better agreement with NNR-MORVEL56 than with NNR-NUVEL-1A for all plates, except for Australia where we observe an average residual rotation rate of 4 mm/a. Using our selection of sites, we found large global X-rotation rates between the two models (0.016°/Ma) and between our model and NNR-MORVEL56 of 0.023°/Ma, equivalent to 2.5 mm/a at the Earth surface.},

abstract = {We here analyse an InSAR dataset which constrains the temporal and spatial distribution of post-seismic ground displacement following the 1997 Manyi (Tibet) earthquake to estimate the depth-variation of creep viscosity within the crust. We use a method which depends on the detection and measurement of a systematic variation in post-seismic relaxation rate with distance from the fault. At a given distance the displacement rates may be compared with the prediction of a uniform viscosity model with apparent viscosity ?? u. The rate at which ?? u decreases with distance from the fault is directly diagnostic of the parameter that controls the vertical gradient of viscosity in a stratified crust. Our best-fit viscosity profile for Manyi exponentially decreases from 1.2??10 21Pas at the top of the visco-elastic layer (at 10km) to 1.6??10 18Pas at the Moho (at 60km). The predicted temporal and spatial variations of post-seismic displacements generally fit the observed post day-165 displacements within error, if we assume that displacements pre day-165 are attributed to after-slip on the fault. Within error, the crustal viscosity at 10km depth may range between {\~{}}6.1??10 20Pas and {\~{}}1.4??10 22Pas. Estimates of the Maxwell time constant consistent with an inter-seismic period of {\~{}}500-1000yr imply an effective elastic layer thickness of {\~{}}20km for best-fit and upper bound viscosity solutions. We also show that the estimated viscosity profile is broadly consistent with laboratory measurements of creep for crustal materials like quartzite and granite by deducing from our viscosity profile the ratio (Q/n) of activation energy to stress exponent at {\~{}}45-81kJ/mole, thus providing a new link between laboratory-scale measurements of creep deformation and viscosity measured from post-seismic relaxation. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Stress changes in the crust due to an earthquake can hasten the failure of neighbouring faults and induce earthquake sequences in some cases. The 1999 Hector Mine earthquake in southern California (magnitude 7.1) occurred only 20 km from, and 7 years after, the 1992 Landers earthquake (magnitude 7.3). This suggests that the Hector Mine earthquake was triggered in some fashion by the earlier event. But uncertainties in the slip distribution and rock friction properties associated with the Landers earthquake have led to widely varying estimates of both the magnitude and sign of the resulting stress change that would be induced at the location of the Hector Mine hypocentre-with estimates varying from -1.4 bar (ref. 6) to +0.5 bar (ref. 7). More importantly, coseismic stress changes alone cannot satisfactorily explain the delay of 7 years between the two events. Here we present the results of a three-dimensional viscoelastic model that simulates stress transfer from the ductile lower crust and upper mantle to the brittle upper crust in the 7 years following the Landers earthquake. Using viscoelastic parameters that can reproduce the observed horizontal surface deformation following the Landers earthquake, our calculations suggest that lower-crustal or upper-mantle flow can lead to postseismic stress increases of up to 1-2 bar at the location of the Hector Mine hypocentre during this time period, contributing to the eventual occurrence of the 1999 Hector Mine earthquake. These results attest to the importance of considering viscoelastic processes in the assessment of seismic hazard.},

abstract = {Current national seismic hazard models for Cascadia use the zone of episodic tremor and slip (ETS) to denote the lower boundary of the seismogenic zone. Recent numerical models have suggested that an appreciable amount of long-term strain may accumulate at the depth of ETS and questions this assumption. We use uplift rates from leveling campaigns spanning approximately 50-70 yrs in Washington and Oregon to investigate the amount of potential long-term locking near the ETS zone. We evaluate the potential for deeper locking in Cascadia by exploring a range of locking parameters along the subduction zone, including the ETS zone. Of the four east-west leveling profiles studied, three show a reduction in the misfit when secondary locking near the ETS zone is included; however the reduction in misfit values is only statistically significant for one profile. This would suggest that models including a small amount of secondary locking are broadly indistinguishable from models without any secondary locking. If secondary locking is considered, the leveling data allow for locking up to {\~{}}20{\%} of the plate rate near the updip edge of the ETS zone. These results are consistent with, but less resolved, by GPS observations.},

abstract = {We employ a modified version of the Network Inversion Filter to investigate time-dependent slip following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Previous analysis of Global Positioning System (GPS) and leveling data suggests afterslip on the Loma Prieta rupture as well as aseismic slip on a thrust fault northeast of the San Andreas fault which we identify with the Foothills thrust belt. We analyzed 173 daily GPS solution files at 62 stations collected from 1989.8 to 1998.3 (a total of 1,134 three-dimensional relative baseline determinations). The observed position changes are assumed to result from secular deformation, random benchmark motions, and temporally varying fault slip. The data reveal temporal variations in slip rate but poorly resolve spatial variations in fault slip. The amount of temporal smoothing is estimated by maximum likelihood. Conditional on this estimate, reverse slip on the Foothills thrust decays from 45 12 mm/yr immediately, after the earthquake to zero by 1992. Reverse slip on the Loma Prieta rupture surface decays from 57 11 mm/yr to zero by 1994. Right-lateral slip on the Loma Prieta rupture surface decays monotonically from 30 10 mm/yr to zero by 1994. These results suggest that (1) triggered afterslip can occur off the main rupture zone on adjacent faults, (2) shallow afterslip dominated the postseismic deformation for the 8 years following the earth-quake, and (3) postseismic slip on the Foothills thrust may account for a significant portion of its total slip budget.},

abstract = {As oceanic lithosphere subducts beneath continental lithosphere it experiences variable degrees of interaction with the overriding plate and movement is accommodated by a continuum of slip modes(1). At shallow depths, the plates are locked and movement occurs intermittently as earthquakes. By contrast, at large depths the down-going plate slips into the mantle continually. In the transition zone between locked and stable slip, plate movement is accommodated by slow slip(2), which generates tectonic tremor(3). Here we use tectonic tremor to infer the location and duration of slow slip in the Cascadia subduction zone from 2006 to 2011. We find that individual slow-slip events are initiated deep on the plate interface and migrate upwards. With decreasing depth, we observe a gradation from small, frequent slip, to large, infrequent slip. These observations fill in the transition zone with a continuum of slip size and periodicity, and indicate that the fault weakens with depth, which we attribute to lower friction. We suggest that stable sliding loads the fault at depth and transfers stress to the base of the transition zone, causing the initiation of slow slip. In a self-similar process, slow slip migrates upwards and ratchets stress up the fault, towards the shallower seismogenic zone. Our conceptual model provides an intuitive understanding of subduction zone dynamics.},

This result enables two robust conclusions regarding the nature of lithospheric strength in this region: the mantle is weaker than the lower crust, and flow occurs over a wide region of mantle as opposed to within a narrow shear zone beneath the fault.},

abstract = {We have developed a tool to detect transient deformation signals from large‐scale (principally GPS) geodetic arrays, referred to as a Network Strain Filter (NSF). The strategy is to extract spatially and temporally coherent signals by analyzing data from entire geodetic networks simultaneously. The NSF models GPS displacement time series as a sum of contributions from secular motion, transient displacements, site‐specific local benchmark motion, reference frame errors, and white noise. Transient displacements are represented by a spatial wavelet basis with temporally varying coefficients that are estimated with a Kalman filter. A temporal smoothing parameter is also estimated online by the filter. The problem is regularized in the spatial domain by minimizing a smoothing (Laplacian) norm of the transient strain rate field. To test the performance of the NSF, we carried out numerical tests using the Southern California Integrated GPS Network station distribution and a 3 year long synthetic transient in a 6 year time series. We demonstrate that the NSF can identify the transient signal, even when the colored noise amplitude is comparable to that of transient signal. Application of the method to actual GPS data from the Japanese GPS network (GEONET) on the Boso Peninsula also shows that the NSF can detect transient motions resulting from aseismic fault slip.},

abstract = {It has been agreed for nearly a century that a strong, load-bearing outer layer of earth is required to support mountain ranges, transmit stresses to deform active regions, and store elastic strain to generate earthquakes. However, the depth and extent of this strong layer remain controversial. Here we use a variety of observations to infer the distribution of lithospheric strength in the active western United States from seismic to steady-state time scales. We use evidence from post-seismic transient and earthquake cycle deformation, reservoir loading, glacioisostatic adjustment, and lithosphere isostatic adjustment to large surface and subsurface loads. The nearly perfectly elastic behavior of Earth{\&}{\#}39;s crust and mantle at the time scale of seismic wave propagation evolves to that of a strong, elastic crust and weak, ductile upper mantle lithosphere at both earthquake cycle (EC, {\~{}}100 to 103 yr) and glacioisostatic adjustment (GIA, {\~{}}103 to 104 yr) time scales. Topography and gravity field correlations indicate that lithosphere isostatic adjustment (LIA) on {\~{}}106{\&}{\#}8211;107 yr time scales occurs with most lithospheric stress supported by an upper crust overlying a much weaker ductile substrate. These comparisons suggest that the upper mantle lithosphere is weaker than the crust at all time scales longer than seismic. In contrast, the lower crust has a chameleon-like behavior, strong at EC and GIA time scales and weak for LIA and steady-state deformation processes. The lower crust might even take on a third identity in regions of rapid crustal extension or continental collision, where anomalously high temperatures may lead to large-scale ductile flow in a lower crustal layer that is locally weaker than the upper mantle. Modeling of lithospheric processes in active regions thus cannot use a one-size-fits-all prescription of rheological layering (relation between applied stress and deformation as a function of depth) but must be tailored to the time scale and tectonic setting of the process being investigated.},

abstract = {Geodetic observations of interseismic deformation across the Tibetan plateau contain information about both tectonic and earthquake cycle processes. Time-variations in surface velocities between large earthquakes are sensitive to the rheological structure of the subseismogenic crust, and, in particular, the viscosity of the middle and lower crust. Here we develop a semianalytic solution for time-dependent interseismic velocities resulting from viscoelastic stress relaxation in a localized midcrustal layer in response to forcing by a sequence of periodic earthquakes. Earthquake cycle models with a weak midcrustal layer exhibit substantially more near-fault preseismic strain localization than do classic two-layer models at short ({\textless}100 yr) Maxwell times. We apply both this three-layer model and the classic two-layer model to geodetic observations before and after the 1997 MW = 7.6 Manyi and 2001 MW = 7.8 Kokoxili strike-slip earthquakes in Tibet to estimate the viscosity of the crust below a 20 km thick seismogenic layer. For these events, interseismic stress relaxation in a weak (viscosity ≤1018.5 Pa⋅s) and thin (height ≤20 km) midcrustal layer explains observations of both preseismic near-fault strain localization and rapid ({\textgreater}50 mm/yr) postseismic velocities in the years following the coseismic ruptures. We suggest that earthquake cycle models with a localized midcrustal layer can simultaneously explain both preseismic and postseismic geodetic observations with a single Maxwell viscosity, while the classic two-layer model requires a rheology with multiple relaxation time scales.},

abstract = {Geodetic observations of both coseismic and interseismic surface deformation fields in the vicinity of subduction zones are frequently interpreted using simple elastic dislocation models (EDMs). The geometry of the megathrust interface used in these models has a first order effect on their predicted surface deformation. Here, we systematically explore the sensitivity of the surface velocity field predicted by EDMs both early and late in the seismic cycle, to parameterizations of megathrust interface geometry, effective subducting plate thickness, and gradual transitions in apparent plate coupling. We focus on how these parameterizations affect the hingeline - the location where vertical velocities switch from subsidence to uplift - as well as the location of the peak uplift rates. We find that these surface observables are much less sensitive to uncertainties in dip at the downdip end of the seismogenic zone for realistic curved faults in comparison to planar faults. For realistic megathrust geometries (planar or curved) having gradual transitions in apparent plate coupling, we find that the extent of locking is best approximated at the surface by the location of peak uplift rates. Therefore, the common notion - based on shallow-dipping planar faults - that the hingeline is located directly above the maximum depth extent of the locked plate interface is generally incorrect. Using the hingeline as the basis for coupling may lead to a significant underestimation of seismic hazard early in the cycle, as well as during the interseismic period. This analysis also demonstrates the importance of considering both vertical and horizontal velocities for determining seismic source extents, as well as interseismic coupling, on the megathrust. The tradeoffs presented here between the geometry of the megathrust and fault coupling along its surface can assist in the planning of campaign-GPS or field geologic surveys, and help improve seismic hazard estimates in active subduction zones. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The crust around the rupture zone of the 1992 Landers earthquake has continued to deform in the years following the earthquake at rates similar to 3 times greater than pre-earthquake rates. We use a combination of Global Positioning System (GPS) and synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data collected during a similar to 3-year epoch following the earthquake in order to investigate postseismic mechanisms responsible for the high transient velocities. In order to maximize the potential signal from viscoelastic relaxation we evaluate and model postseismic relaxation following the first few months of documented accelerated deformation. The combination of GPS and InSAR data allows us to establish viscoelastic relaxation of the lower crust and upper mantle as the dominant postseismic process and to discriminate among possible viscoelastic models. The data particularly require the presence of a highly ductile uppermost mantle beneath the central Mojave Domain, with temperature between the wet and dry basalt solidus. This is consistent with independent seismic and geochemical inferences of a regionally warm uppermost mantle. Further consideration of seismic velocity variations in conjunction with faulting patterns within the Mojave Desert suggests that the primary faulting characteristics of the Mojave Desert, namely, the pervasive late Cenozoic deformation within the Eastern California Shear Zone versus the near absence of faults in the Western Mojave Domain, are controlled by the rheology of the uppermost mantle.},

abstract = {Continuous GPS stations in the Pacific Northwest Geodetic Array network clearly record subduction-related strain accumulation and slow slip episodes along the Cascadia convergent margin. Many of the slow slip episodes have been correlated in time and space with seismic evidence for nonvolcanic tremor, leading to the previous discovery of episodic tremor and slip (ETS). In this study, we use a hyperbolic tangent curve fitting technique for the identification of slow slip times and displacement magnitudes within the GPS time series, independent of seismic tremor data. We then apply this technique to study the patterns of strain accumulation and release associated with ETS events and characterize patterns of coupling associated with the locked and transition zones of the plate interface. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this automated technique for both identification of slow slip observations and calculation of slow slip displacements. Recurrence patterns in the distribution of GPS observations demonstrate coherence among neighboring stations over time and apparent along-strike segmentation of the subduction interface. When slow slip events are removed from the time series, we can estimate the total site velocities between slow slip events. These velocities decay as depth to the subduction interface increases, but they diverge from the long-term trends expected from the interseismic cycle at similar to 30-60 km above the interface, consistent with the location where slow slip displacements occur. Forward modeling of coupling on the plate interface reveals that in between slow slip events there is a patch of at least 30{\%} coupling from 20 to 35 km depth, which is needed to produce the observed back slip displacements. Intriguingly, our best fitting models have a decrease in coupling down to similar to 30{\%} at similar to 20 km depth followed by a peak of greater than 80{\%} coupling at similar to 30-35 km depth, suggesting the source zone for ETS events acts as a distinct locking zone that releases strain more frequently than the updip seismogenic locked zone, although a zone of constant similar to 30{\%} coupling cannot be ruled out with this data set. Such a scenario indicates that frictional behavior with depth follows a more complex model than a simple temperature controlled transition. We propose that coupling initially decreases with depth due to a decrease in strength of the overriding lower crust, but then coupling increases again when the subducting plate comes in contact with the stronger overriding mantle.},

abstract = {We review a set of geological and geophysical observations that strongly support a coherent deformation of the entire lithosphere in major intracontinental wrench faults. Tectonic studies of wrench faults eroded down to the middle to lower crust show that, even in cases in which the lower to middle crust is partially melted, strain remains localized (although less efficiently) in transcurrent shear zones. Seismic profiling as well as seismic tomography and magnetotelluric soundings provide strong argument in favour of major wrench faults crosscutting the Moho and deforming the upper mantle. Pn velocity anisotropy, shear-wave splitting and electric conductivity anisotropy measurements over major wrench faults and in transpressional domains support that a wrench fault fabric exists over most or even the entire lithosphere thickness. These seismic and electrical anisotropies are generated by a crystallographic preferred orientation of olivine and pyroxenes developed in the mantle during the fault activity, which is frozen in the lithospheric mantle when the deformation stops. ne preservation of such a 'wrench fault type' fabric within the upper mantle may have major effects on the subsequent tectonothermal behaviour of continents, because olivine is mechanically and thermally anisotropic. Indeed, the association of numerical models and laboratory data on textured mantle rocks strongly suggests that the orogenic continental lithosphere is an anisotropic medium with regards to its stiffness and to heat diffusion. This anisotropy may explain the frequent reactivation, at the continents scale, of ancient lithospheric-scale wrench faults and transpressional belts during subsequent tectonic events.},

@article{Kirby1985,
abstract = {Emphasized in this paper are the deformation processes and rheologies of rocks at high temperatures and high effective pressures, conditions that are presumably appropriate to the lower crust and upper mantle in continental collision zones. Much recent progress has been made in understanding the flexure of the oceanic lithosphere using rock-mechanics-based yield criteria for the inelastic deformations at the top and base. At mid-plate depths, stresses are likely to be supported elastically because bending strains and elastic stresses are low. The collisional tectonic regime, however, is far more complex because very large permanent strains are sustained at mid-plate depths and this requires us to include the broad transition between brittle and ductile flow. Moreover, important changes in the ductile flow mechanisms occur at the intermediate temperatures found at mid-plate depths. Two specific contributions of laboratory rock rheology research are considered in this paper. First, the high-temperature steady-state flow mechanisms and rheology of mafic and ultramafic rocks are reviewed with special emphasis on olivine and crystalline rocks. Rock strength decreases very markedly with increases in temperature and it is the onset of flow by high temperature ductile mechanisms that defines the base of the lithosphere. The thickness of the continental lithosphere can therefore be defined by the depth to a particular isotherm Tc above which (at geologic strain rates) the high-temperature ductile strength falls below some arbitrary strength isobar (e.g., 100 MPa). For olivine Tc is about 700°–800°C but for other crustal silicates, Tc may be as low as 400°–600°C, suggesting that substantial decoupling may take place within thick continental crust and that strength may increase with depth at the Moho, as suggested by a number of workers on independent grounds. Put another way, the Moho is a rheological discontinuity. A second class of laboratory observations pertains to the general phenomenon of ductile faulting in which ductile strains are localized into shear zones. Ductile faults have been produced in experiments of five different rock types and is generally expressed as strain softening in constant-strain-rate tests or as an accelerating-creep-rate stage at constant differential stress. A number of physical mechanisms have been identified that may be responsible for ductile faulting, including the onset of dynamic recrystallization, phase changes, hydrothermal alteration and hydrolytic weakening. Microscopic evidence for these processes as well as larger-scale geological and geophysical observations suggest that ductile faulting in the middle to lower crust and upper mantle may greatly influence the distribution and magnitudes of differential stresses and the style of deformation in the overlying upper continental lithosphere.},

The commonly used approach$\backslash$nto regional filtering assumes that the common mode error is spatially$\backslash$nuniform, which is a good approximation for networks of hundreds of$\backslash$nkilometers extent, but breaks down as the spatial extent increases.$\backslash$nA more rigorous approach should remove the assumption of spatially$\backslash$nuniform distribution and let the data themselves reveal the spatial$\backslash$ndistribution of the common mode error. The principal component analysis$\backslash$n(PCA) and the Karhunen-Loeve expansion (KLE) both decompose network$\backslash$ntime series into a set of temporally varying modes and their spatial$\backslash$nresponses. Therefore they provide a mathematical framework to perform$\backslash$nspatiotemporal filtering. We apply the combination of PCA and KLE$\backslash$nto daily station coordinate time series of the Southern California$\backslash$nIntegrated GPS Network (SCIGN) for the period 2000 to 2004. We demonstrate$\backslash$nthat spatially and temporally correlated common mode errors are the$\backslash$ndominant error source in daily GPS solutions.

abstract = {Geodetic observations of post-seismic ground motion reflect the integrated effects of several relaxation mechanisms. To evaluate the viscous relaxation component accurately the crustal viscosity structure beneath a region must be estimated. In this study, using a 3-D finite element model,we describe the viscoelastic relaxation that follows an instantaneous strike-slip faulting event in a crustal layer whose viscosity decreases exponentially with depth. At any surface observation point the depth-dependent viscosity(DDV) model displacement history closely fits the history predicted for a uniform viscosity (UNV) model. The difference can be minimized to obtain the UNV viscosity ($\eta$u) that best fits the DDV model displacement at that location. The differences in displacement histories between DDV and best-fit UNV models are minor but depend on distance from fault, the viscosity gradient and the fault configuration. In the near field, theDDVmodel prediction can bewell approximated by theUNVmodel, regardless of the viscosity gradient and fault configuration. On the other hand, in the far field, small differences betweenDDVmodel and best-fitUNVmodel become apparent: the displacements are controlled by greater viscosities in later phases, and the differences are greater for DDV models with greater viscosity gradient. The more important result we obtain is that: apparent viscosity $\eta$u decreases with distance from the fault, and its rate of decrease is directly diagnostic of the vertical viscosity gradient. This result points to a practical method of analysing post- seismic ground-displacement data for the variation of viscosity in the ductile crust; the apparent crustal viscosity should be determined at a series of points at increasing distance from the fault. The variation of apparent viscosity with distance can then be used to directly infer the vertical gradient of viscosity in the crust.},

abstract = {A simple two-dimensional model of the earthquake cycle (preearthquake strain accumulation, coseismic strain release, and postseismic readjustment) has been constructed from the Nur-Mavko solution for a screw dislocation in an elastic plate (lithosphere) overlying a viscoelastic substrate (asthenosphere). The deformation at the free surface is calculated for an earthquake cycle imposed by prescribed slip on a transform fault. This deformation is compared to that produced by a similar cycle in an elastic half space so that the effects of viscoelastic relaxation in the asthenosphere may be isolated. The following conclusions are drawn: (1) The surface deformation produced by viscoelastic relaxation in the asthenosphere can be duplicated identically by a reasonable distribution of slip at depth on a vertical fault in an elastic half space. Thus differentiation of two possible modes of postearthquake readjustment will be difficult. (2) The effect of asthenosphere relaxation is important only if the depth of the seismic zone is comparable to the thickness of the lithosphere. If the seismic zone is 15 km deep and the lithosphere is 75 km thick, as commonly estimated for the San Andreas fault zone, asthenosphere relaxation is not particularly significant in determining surface deformation. (3) In a periodic sequence of earthquakes the principal observable effects of viscoelasticity in the asthenosphere are to produce a rapid postearthquake deformation and to concentrate strain accumulation and relaxation even closer to the fault than in the elastic half-space model.},

abstract = {Several common classes of model‐free strain estimation techniques from geodetic deformation measurements were investigated to assess the systematic computational artifacts introduced into strain estimates from different parameterizations. It is demonstrated that highly structured artifacts, which may be impossible to distinguish from real variations in strain, persistently appear in the strain rate field at and above the spatial scale of the network that samples the deformation field. These computational artifacts are biased by the spatial sampling, and by the orientation of the sampling network with respect to the deformation field. While such aliased strain rate representations provide some gross representation of the underlying real strain rate field, they contain numerous small‐scale artifacts. As a result, in the absence of a tectonic model, the interpretation of strain rates from heterogeneous networks have limited direct use for interpreting subtleties in the underlying driving mechanisms.},

The best-fitting models generally have a high-viscosity lower crust ({\&}{\#}951; = 1021 Pa s) overlying a lower-viscosity upper mantle ({\&}{\#}951; = 1019 Pa s).

Here we focus on records from a seismometer located on a rocky outcrop in the vicinity of the grounding line of the 35 km broad Mertz glacier, a major outflow of this region. We detect numerous icequakes (50,000 events within 10 months and up to 100 events/h) and demonstrate their clear tidal modulation. We suggest that they result from ice friction and fracturing around the rocky peak and from the glacier flexure in response to the falling and rising tides at its grounding area. We propose that such icequake monitoring could be used as a climate proxy since grounding lines are subject to migrate with sea level changes.

Events are relocated using a series of absolute and relative relocation procedures that include Hypoinverse, Velest, and hypoDD. Location errors are reduced to ∼40 m horizontally and ∼120 m vertically. Aftershock locations reveal a complex pattern of faulting with en echelon fault segments trending toward the northwest, approximately parallel to the North American-Pacific plate boundary and en echelon, conjugate features trending to the northeast. The relocated seismicity is highly correlated with published surface mapping of faults that experienced triggered surface slip in response to the EMC main shock. Aftershocks occurred between 2 km and 11 km depths, consistent with previous studies of seismogenic thickness in the region. Three-dimensional analysis reveals individual and intersecting fault planes that are limited in their along-strike length. These fault planes remain distinct structures at depth, indicative of conjugate faulting, and do not appear to coalesce onto a throughgoing fault segment. We observe a complex spatiotemporal migration of aftershocks, with seismicity that jumps between individual fault segments that are active for only a few days to weeks. Aftershock rates are roughly consistent with the expected earthquake production rates of Dieterich (1994). The conjugate pattern of faulting and nonuniform aftershock migration patterns suggest that strain in the Yuha Desert is being accommodated in a complex manner.},

First, two new asymptotic relations for the overall creep function are derived at short and large times. They are related to the retardation spectrum of the composite and involve second-order moments per phase of the stress field for the purely elastic and purely viscous problems. In the context of harmonic loadings, these relations provide exact frequential asymptotic conditions on the overall storage and loss moduli. Second, by making use of these asymptotic results, an approximate model is proposed. It consists in approximating the retardation spectrum of the composite by a single discrete Dirac mass. Its accuracy is assessed by comparison with exact analytical results, full-field simulations and collocation results for several classes of composites and polycrystals. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Studies of the Earth's response to large earthquakes can be viewed as large rock deformation experiments in which sudden stress changes induce viscous flow in the lower crust and upper mantle that lead to observable postseismic surface deformation. Laboratory experiments suggest that viscous flow of deforming hot lithospheric rocks is characterized by a power law in which strain rate is proportional to stress raised to a power, n (refs 2, 3). Most geodynamic models of flow in the lower crust and upper mantle, however, resort to newtonian (linear) stress-strain rate relations. Here we show that a power-law model of viscous flow in the mantle with n = 3.5 successfully explains the spatial and temporal evolution of transient surface deformation following the 1992 Landers and 1999 Hector Mine earthquakes in southern California. A power-law rheology implies that viscosity varies spatially with stress causing localization of strain, and varies temporally as stress evolves, rendering newtonian models untenable. Our findings are consistent with laboratory-derived flow law parameters for hot and wet olivine--the most abundant mineral in the upper mantle--and support the contention that, at least beneath the Mojave desert, the upper mantle is weaker than the lower crust.},

abstract = {Changes in the level of ancient Lake Cahuilla over the last 1500 years in the Salton Trough alter the state of stress by bending the lithosphere in response to the applied lake load and by varying the pore pressure magnitude within the crust. The recurrence interval of the lake is similar to the recurrence interval of rupture on the southern San Andreas and San Jacinto faults, both of which are partially covered by the lake at its highstand. Furthermore, four of the last five ruptures on the southern San Andreas fault have occurred near a time of substantial lake level change. We investigate the effect of Coulomb stress perturbations on local faults due to changing level of Lake Cahuilla to determine a possible role for the lake in affecting the timing of fault rupture. Coulomb stress is calculated with a three-dimensional model of an elastic plate overlying a viscoelastic half-space. Plate thickness and half-space relaxation time are adjusted to match observed vertical deformation since the last lake highstand. The lake cycle causes positive and negative Coulomb stress perturbations of 0.2-0.6 MPa on the southern San Andreas within the lake and 0.1-0.2 MPa on the southern San Andreas outside the lake. These Coulomb stress perturbations are comparable to stress magnitudes known to have triggered events at other faults along the North America-Pacific plate boundary.},

abstract = {Since a regional earthquake in 1951, shallow creep events on strike-slip faults within the Salton Trough, Southern California have been triggered at least 10 times by M ≥ 5.4 earthquakes within 200 km. The high earthquake and creep activity and the long history of digital recording within the Salton Trough region provide a unique opportunity to study the mechanism of creep event triggering by nearby earthquakes. Here, we document the history of fault creep events on the Superstition Hills Fault based on data from creepmeters, InSAR, and field surveys since 1988. We focus on a subset of these creep events that were triggered by significant nearby earthquakes. We model these events by adding realistic static and dynamic perturbations to a theoretical fault model based on rate-and state-dependent friction. We find that the static stress changes from the causal earthquakes are less than 0.1 MPa and too small to instantaneously trigger creep events. In contrast, we can reproduce the characteristics of triggered slip with dynamic perturbations alone. The instantaneous triggering of creep events depends on the peak and the time-integrated amplitudes of the dynamic Coulomb stress change. Based on observations and simulations, the stress change amplitude required to trigger a creep event of a 0.01-mm surface slip is about 0.6 MPa. This threshold is at least an order of magnitude larger than the reported triggering threshold of non-volcanic tremors (2–60 kPa) and earthquakes in geothermal fields (5 kPa) and near shale gas production sites (0.2–0.4 kPa), which may result from differences in effective normal stress, fault friction, the density of nucleation sites in these systems, or triggering mechanisms. We conclude that shallow frictional heterogeneity can explain both the spontaneous and dynamically triggered creep events on the Superstition Hills Fault.},

We correct observed source spectra for attenuation using both fixed and spatially varying empirical Green's function methods. Estimated Brune-type stress drops for over 60,000 M L = 1.5 to 3.1 earthquakes range from 0.2 to 20 MPa with no dependence on moment or local b value. Median computed stress drop increases with depth in the upper crust, from about 0.6 MPa at the surface to about 2.2 MPa at 8 km, where it levels off and remains nearly constant in the midcrust down to about 20 km. However, the results at shallow depths could also be explained as reduced rupture velocities near the surface rather than a change in stress drop. Spatially coherent variations in median stress drop are observed, with generally low values for the Imperial Valley and Northridge aftershocks and higher values for the eastern Transverse ranges and the north end of the San Jacinto fault. We find no correlation between observed stress drop and distance from the San Andreas and other major faults. Significant along-strike variations in stress drop exist for aftershocks of the 1992 Landers earthquake, which may correlate with differences in main shock slip.},

abstract = {We use idealized subduction megathrust models to examine aseismic, frictional fault creep throughout the interseismic period.We consider rate-dependent and rate- and state-dependent friction. When there is significant post-seismic creep surrounding locations of coseismic slip, the creep rates surrounding an asperity may be lower than the plate convergence rate late in the seismic cycle. This lowering of the creep rates is due to stress shadows forming around the interseismically locked asperities. The size of the stress shadows increases as there is more transient post-seismic creep. Larger asperities produce larger interseismic stress shadows, and multiple asperities can act together to produce a stress shadow larger than the sum of the effects of the individual asperities. For rate-state frictional megathrusts, there is a wide range of transient post-seismic creep that occurs: from pulses of post-seismic creep with decreasing creep rates through time, to delayed post-seismic creep. Delayed post-seismic creep may occur well into the interseismic period, with transient creep lasting over a significant portion of the seismic cycle. Delayed post-seismic creep is generally favoured in velocity strengthening regions with either a larger magnitude of the frictional direct effect or a larger effective normal stress. In addition, regions of the fault undergoing delayed post-seismic creep must be above steady state following coseismic slip.},

In contrast, the summed geodetic rate across the Mojave eastern California shear zone (ECSZ) is significantly higher than the summed geologic rate. We show that geodetic and geologic slip rates in Southern California can be reconciled using a viscoelastic earthquake cycle model that explicitly incorporates time-dependent deformation due to nonsteady interseismic fault creep in the lower crust and viscous flow in the upper mantle. To reconcile geologic and geodetic model rates, our model requires that the southern San Andreas fault and the Garlock fault are in the late stages of the earthquake cycle, resulting in lower current deformation rates than the cycle-averaged rate. Our model implies that the ECSZ and the San Jacinto faults are in the early stages of the earthquake cycle, resulting in high current deformation rates.},

This relatively rapid motion occurs within the framework of the slow-moving (∼5 mm/yr relative motions) Eurasian, Nubian, and Somalian plates. The circulatory pattern of motion increases in rate toward the Hellenic trench system. We develop an elastic block model to constrain present-day plate motions (relative Euler vectors), regional deformation within the interplate zone, and slip rates for major faults. Substantial areas of continental lithosphere within the region of plate interaction show coherent motion with internal deformations below ∼1–2 mm/yr, including central and eastern Anatolia (Turkey), the southwestern Aegean/Peloponnesus, the Lesser Caucasus, and Central Iran. Geodetic slip rates for major block-bounding structures are mostly comparable to geologic rates estimated for the most recent geological period (∼3–5 Myr). We find that the convergence of Arabia with Eurasia is accommodated in large part by lateral transport within the interior part of the collision zone and lithospheric shortening along the Caucasus and Zagros mountain belts around the periphery of the collision zone. In addition, we find that the principal boundary between the westerly moving Anatolian plate and Arabia (East Anatolian fault) is presently characterized by pure left-lateral strike slip with no fault-normal convergence. This implies that “extrusion” is not presently inducing westward motion of Anatolia. On the basis of the observed kinematics, we hypothesize that deformation in the Africa-Arabia-Eurasia collision zone is driven in large part by rollback of the subducting African lithosphere beneath the Hellenic and Cyprus trenches aided by slab pull on the southeastern side of the subducting Arabian plate along the Makran subduction zone. We further suggest that the separation of Arabia from Africa is a response to plate motions induced by active subduction.},

abstract = {We develop a two-dimensional boundary element earthquake cycle model including deep interseismic creep on vertical strike-slip faults in an elastic lithosphere coupled to a viscoelastic asthenosphere. Uniform slip on the upper part of the fault is prescribed periodically to represent great strike-slip earthquakes. Below the coseismic rupture the fault creeps in response to lithospheric shear stresses within a narrow linear viscous fault zone. The model is applied to the GPS contemporary velocity field across the Carrizo Plain and northern San Francisco Bay segments of the San Andreas fault, as well as triangulation measurements of postseismic strain following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Previous analysis of these data, using conventional viscoelastic coupling models without stress-driven creep [Segall, 2002], shows that it is necessary to invoke different lithosphere-asthenosphere rheology in northern and southern California in order to explain the data. We show that with deep stress-driven interseismic creep on the San Andreas fault, the data can be explained with the same rheology for northern and southern California. We estimate elastic thickness in the range 44-100 km (95{\%} confidence level), fault zone viscosity per unit width of 0.5-8.2 x 10(17) Pa s/m, and asthenosphere relaxation time of 24-622 years (0.1-2.9 x 10(20) Pa s) for northern and southern California. We estimate a slip rate of 21-27 mm/yr and recurrence time of 188-315 years for the northern San Francisco Bay San Andreas fault and slip rate of 32-42 mm/yr with recurrence time of 247-536 years for the Carrizo Plain.},

abstract = {Post-seismic deformation is commonly attributed to viscoelastic relaxation and/or afterslip, although discerning between the two driving mechanisms can be difficult. A major complication in modeling post-seismic deformation is that forward models can be computationally expensive, making it difficult to adequately search model space to find the optimal fault slip distribution and lithospheric viscosity structure that can explain observable post-seismic deformation. We propose an inverse method which uses coseismic and early post-seismic deformation to rapidly and simultaneously estimate a fault slip history and an arbitrarily discretized viscosity structure of the lithosphere. Our method is based on an approximation which is applicable to the early post-seismic period and expresses surface deformation resulting from viscoelastic relaxation as a linearized function with respect to lithospheric fluidity. We demonstrate this approximation using two-dimensional earthquake models. We validate the approximation and our inverse method using two three-dimensional synthetic tests. The success of our synthetic tests suggests that our method is capable of distinguishing the mechanisms driving early post-seismic deformation and recovering an effective viscosity structure of the lithosphere.},

abstract = {Strainmeters can record offsets coincident with earthquakes, but how much these represent strain changes from elastic rebound, and how much they are contaminated by local effects, remains an open question. To study this, we use a probabilistic detection method to estimate coseismic offsets on nine borehole strainmeters (BSMs) operated by the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) in southern California, from 34 earthquakes with a wide range of magnitudes and distances. In general, the offsets estimated for the BSM data differ substantially from the static strain predicted by elastic dislocation theory, which is well supported by other techniques, though 10{\%} of the observed offsets agree well with theory. For one earthquake, the BSM offsets significantly disagree with collocated long‐base laser strainmeter data. Comparisons with collocated seismic data provide strong evidence that the absolute errors between the observed and predicted strains scale with the level of seismic energy density but also that relative errors (normalized by the model size) do not. We conclude that apparent strain offsets are induced by seismic waves, occurring presumably because of irreversible deformation, whether in the rock or cementing materials close to the BSMs, or in the instruments themselves. Coseismic offsets seen in PBO BSM data should therefore be viewed with caution before being used as a measure of large‐scale coseismic deformation.Online Material: Tables of offset estimates and predictions, error estimates, strike sensitivities, and figures of observed versus predicted offsets.},

abstract = {A uniformly valid linear viscoelastic rheology is described which takes the form of a generalized' Burgers' body and which appears capable of reconciling the behaviour of the Earth's mantle across the complete spectrum of geodynamic time-scales. This spectrum is bracketed by the short time-scales of body wave and free oscillation seismology on which anelastic effects are dominant, and the long time-scale of mantle convection on which the Earth behaves viscously. The parameters of the model which control the viscous response are fixed by post-glacial rebound data whereas those which govern the anelasticity are to be determined by fitting the model to observations of seismic Q. The paper is concerned primarily with a discussion of the normal mode spectrum of the Earth as a generalized Burgers' body. Focusing upon the homogeneous model, it includes an initial analysis of the accuracy of first-order perturbation theory as a method of calculating the respective Qs of the elastic gravitational free oscillations. Also considered are the quasi-static modes of relaxation which only exact eigenanalysis can reveal. The importance of these modes is assessed within the context of a discussion of the effect of viscoelasticity upon the efficiency of Chandler wobble excitation.},

abstract = {We explore implications for modeling and noise analysis of stochastic seasonal processes of climatic origin in geodetic time series. Seasonal signals are generally modeled as sinusoids with annual periods (and harmonics thereof), each with constant amplitude and phase. However, environmental noise that underlies the seasonal signal in geodetic time series has a reddened power spectral density (PSD). We investigate the form of the PSD of a time series having a stochastic seasonal component and find that for frequencies greater than the nominal seasonal frequency, the PSD of the time series reflects the PSD of the seasonal amplitudes. For example, if the PSD of the seasonal amplitudes can be expressed as an inverse power law, then the PSD of the time series will behave as an inverse power law for high frequencies. Stochastic seasonal variability will also induce a peak near the nominal seasonal frequency in addition to that of the mean seasonal signal and will be relatively flat below this frequency. It is therefore possible that some of the noise in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) time series reported by others may be associated with neglecting the stochastic component of the seasonal signal. We use a GNSS time series from site ZIMM as an example to demonstrate the existence of a variable seasonal signal (without attributing its cause), and we use an example Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) time series from Alaska to demonstrate that use of a nonstochastic seasonal model can have a significant impact on the value and uncertainty of time-variable rates estimated from the time series},

abstract = {Earthquake nucleation and early seismic propagation are studied in a two-dimensional strike-slip fault model with depth-variable properties. The fault is governed by the Dieterich-Ruina rate and state friction law. We use an efficient and rigorous numerical procedure for elastodynamic analysis of earthquake sequences on slowly loaded faults developed by Lapusta et al. [2000]. We find that for decreasing values of the characteristic slip distance of the friction law, small events appear at the transition from the locked to creeping behavior toward the bottom of the seismogenic zone. Small and large events have very similar nucleation phases in our simulations. Here, by “nucleation phase” we mean gradually accelerating aseismic slip in a small slowly expanding zone before the breakout of the dynamic, seismically detectable event. Moment acceleration (to which velocity seismograms are proportional) in early stages of seismic propagation exhibits irregular fluctuations, in the form of speedups and slowdowns in the moment release rate, consistently with observations as reported by Ellsworth and Beroza [1995]. Our simulations show that such irregular moment acceleration can, at least in part, be due to the heterogeneous stress distribution imprinted on the fault by the arrest of previous small events and by stress concentrations at the borders of creeping regions and to partial arrest of the rupture in velocity-strengthening fault regions which inhibit seismic slip.},

abstract = {The recent discovery of episodic tremor and slip (ETS) in subduction zones is based on slow slip episodes visible in global positioning system observations correlated with nonvolcanic tremor signals on seismometers. ETS occurs just inboard from a region capable of great megathrust earthquakes; however, whether there is any communication between these two processes remains unknown. In this study we use new single-station methods to compile an ETS catalog for the entire Cascadia subduction zone, offshore western North America, and compare the patterns with a variety of along-strike trends for the subducting and overriding plates. Correlated ground vibrations and strain observations are found all along the subduction zone, demonstrating that ETS is an inherent part of the subduction process. There are three broad (300-500 km), coherent zones with different recurrence intervals (14 {\{}+/-{\}} 2, 19 {\{}+/-{\}} 4, 10 {\{}+/-{\}} 2 months), where the interval duration is inversely proportional to upper plate topography and the spatial extent correlates with geologic terranes. These zones are further divided into segments of ETS that occur at times typically offset from each other. The seven largest (100-200 km) segments appear to be located immediately landward from forearc basins interpreted as manifestations of megathrust asperities, implying that there is a spatial link between ETS and earthquake behavior. It is not yet clear if any temporal link exists, but the regional time between ETS episodes could be controlled by strength variations due to composition of geologic terranes.},

abstract = {We derived a model for the co-seismic slip distribution on the faults which ruptured during the Landers earthquake sequence of 28 June 1992. The model is based on the inversion of surface geodetic measurements, primarily vector displacements measured using the Global Positioning System (GPS). The inversion procedure assumes that the slip distribution is to some extent smooth and purely right-lateral strike slip. For a given fault geometry, a family of solutions of varying smoothness can be generated. We choose the optimal model from this family based on cross-validation, which measures the predictive power of the data, and the trade-off of misfit and roughness. Solutions which give roughly equal weight to misfit and smoothness are preferred and have certain features in common: (1) there are two main patches of slip, on the Johnson Valley fault, and on the Homestead Valley, Emerson, and Camp Rock faults; (2) virtually all slip is in the upper 10 to 12 km; and (3) the model reproduces the general features of the geologically measured surface displacements, without prior constraints on the surface slip. In all models, regardless of smoothing, very little slip is required on the fault that represents the Big Bear event, and the total moment of the Landers event is 9 . 10(19) N-m. The nearly simultaneous rupture of multiple distinct faults suggests that much of the crust in this region must have been close to failure prior to the earthquake.},

This is accomplished using rate changes in GPS observed displacement time-series at far-field stations as constraints on the parameters associated with laboratory derived temperature- and stress-dependent flow laws for diffusion and dislocation creep of olivine. We primarily concentrate on the influences of temperature, grain size, and background strain rate to explain observed fast early displacement rates that slow rapidly in the 7. years of postseismic observations. We find that a reasonable fit to the observed time-series cannot be achieved by any combination of flow law parameters and plausible assumptions for the tectonic environment of the mantle beneath the Mojave Desert. We conclude that postseismic relaxation within the mantle following the Hector Mine earthquake likely includes an initial transient weakening phase, suggesting that steady-state flow laws by themselves are insufficient to characterize the flow of mantle rocks when stress conditions evolve. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Where viscosity is discontinuous, but the upper crust and mantle lithosphere have comparable maximum values, surface deformation can be used to approximate force balance and rheological parameters, but tradeoffs mean that estimates of stress and viscosity are effective equivalent values rather than actual values.

abstract = {We present a model of localized, aseismic fault creep during the full interseismic period, including both transient and steady fault creep, in response to a sequence of imposed coseismic slip events and tectonic loading. We consider the behaviour of models with linear viscous, non-linear viscous, rate-dependent friction, and rate- and state-dependent friction fault rheologies. Both the transient post-seismic creep and the pattern of steady interseismic creep rates surrounding asperities depend on recent coseismic slip and fault rheologies. In these models, post-seismic fault creep is manifest as pulses of elevated creep rates that propagate from the coseismic slip, these pulses feature sharper fronts and are longer lived in models with rate-state friction compared to other models. With small characteristic slip distances in rate-state friction models, interseismic creep is similar to that in models with rate-dependent friction faults, except for the earliest periods of post-seismic creep. Our model can be used to constrain fault rheologies from geodetic observations in cases where the coseismic slip history is relatively well known. When only considering surface deformation over a short period of time, there are strong trade-offs between fault rheology and the details of the imposed coseismic slip. Geodetic observations over longer times following an earthquake will reduce these trade-offs, while simultaneous modelling of interseismic and post-seismic observations provide the strongest constraints on fault rheologies.},

Although in marine reflection experiments only P waves are recorded, information on shear properties o the medium si contained in the reflection amplitudes recorded at different distances from the source. Being able to estimate both dialatational and shear properties gives stronger constraints on the lithology. It is therefore desirable to recover both types of elastic parameters from multi-offset seismograms. In the real-data example presented here, the amplitude of the reflections cannot be explained by one parameter related to the dilatational properties (P impedance) only, when, trying to minimize the least-squares fit between synthetic and real multi-offset seismograms. When adding an additional parameter related to the shear properties (Poisson's ratio), the fit between synthetic and real seismograms improves. Synthetic-wavefrom-fitting experiments underline the possibility of recovering Poisson's ration when the P-impedance model is well known from fitting waeveforms recorded at small offsetts. In the real-data example, the resulting models for P impedance and Poisson's ratio are anticorrelated in most depth regions, but are correlated in particular depth region, indicating a sudden change in lithology.},

abstract = {Surface deformation transients measured with the Global Positioning System during the 87 days between the 17 August 1999 Izmit earthquake and the 12 November 1999 Du ¨zce earthquake indicate rapidly decaying aseismic fault slip on and well below the coseismic rupture. Elastic model inversions for time-dependent distributed fault slip, using a network inversion filter approach, show that afterslip was highest between and below the regions of maximum coseismic slip and propa- gated downward to, or even below, the base of the crust. Maximum afterslip rates decayed from greater than 2 m/yr, immediately after the I 1.2 m/yr just prior to the Du ˙zmit earthquake to about eastern Karadere rupture segment and near the I ¨zce earthquake. Maximum afterslip occurred below the ˙zmit hypocenter. Afterslip in the upper 16 km decayed more rapidly than that below the seismogenic zone. These observations are consistent with a phase of rapid aseismic fault slip concentrated near the base of the seismogenic zone. Continued loading from the rapid deep afterslip along the eastern rupture zone is a plausible mechanism that helped trigger the nearby, Mw 7.2, 12 November Du ¨zce earthquake.},

abstract = {We use interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and Global Positioning System (GPS) observations to Investigate static deformation due to the 1999 M-w 7.1 Hector Mine earthquake, that occurred in the eastern California shear zone. Interferometric decorrelation, phase, and azimuth offset measurements indicate regions of surface and near-surface slip, which we use to constrain the geometry of surface rupture. The inferred geometry is spatially complex, with multiple strands. The southern third of the rupture zone consists of three subparallel segments extending about 20 km in length in a N45degreesW direction. The central segment is the simplest, with a single strand crossing the Bullion Mountains and a strike of N10degreesW. The northern third of the rupture zone is characterized by multiple splays, with directions subparallel to strikes in the southern and central. The average strike for the entire rupture is about N30degreesW. The interferograms indicate significant along-strike variations in strain which are consistent with variations in the ground-based slip measurements. Using a variable resolution data sampling routine to reduce the computational burden, we invert the InSAR and GPS data for the fault geometry and distribution of slip. We compare results from assuming an elastic half-space and a layered elastic space. Results from these two elastic models are similar, although the layered-space model predicts more slip at depth than does the half-space model. The layered model predicts a maximum coseismic slip of more than 5 In at a depth of 3 to 6 km. Contrary to preliminary reports, the northern part of the Hector Mine rupture accommodates the maximum slip. Our model predictions for the surface fault offset and total seismic moment agree with both field mapping results and recent seismic models. The inferred shallow slip deficit is enigmatic and may suggest that distributed inelastic yielding occurred in the uppermost few kilometers of the crust during or soon after the earthquake.},

@article{McGuire2003,
abstract = {The large-scale continuous GPS networks that have emerged in the last decade have documented a wide-range of aseismic deformation transients that resulted from physical processes such as aseismic fault slip and magma intrusion. In particular, a new class of (M ∼ 7) slow earthquakes with durations ranging from days to months have been observed with GPS arrays located above the downdip portion of subduction zone thrust interfaces. Interpretation of the displacement time-series resulting from these events is not straightforward owing to the contaminating effects of multiple contributing signals such as fault-slip, local benchmark motion, seasonal effects, and reference frame errors. We have developed a time-dependent inversion algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter which can separate the various signals and allow the space–time evolution of these slow-slip transients to be studied in detail. We applied the inversion algorithm to the 1999 Cascadia slow earthquake. This event had two primary episodes of moment-release separated by a two week period in which relatively little moment-release occurred. The Cascadia event and other slow earthquakes share numerous similarities with both ordinary earthquakes and afterslip transients suggesting that they may represent fault slip under a conditionally stable regime.},

abstract = {We have analyzed geodetic observations to resolve tectonic deformation across the Santa Maria Fold and Thrust Belt, northwest of Santa Barbara, California. The geodetic network forms a braced quadrilateral with ∼40 km sides whose southwest corner is the Vandenberg very long baseline interferometry station. The data include (1) historical triangulation from the 1880s, 1920s and 1950s; (2) electronic distance measurement trilateration from 1971 and 1985; and (3) Global Positioning System observations from 1986 and 1987. We combine the three different types of data to estimate two-dimensional station positions and strain rate parameters simultaneously. Using a model which constrains the relative velocity field to be linear in space and constant in time, we find significant strain rates. The maximum compressive strain is oriented N17°E±5°E, and the compressive strain rate in this direction is 0.13±0.03 $\mu$strain/yr. Under the assumption that the unresolved rotational component of the velocity field is zero, we estimate that the integrated rate of deformation across the basin is 7±1 mm/yr oriented at N03°E±13°. This vector can be decomposed into 6±2 mm/yr of crustal shortening on the general structural trend of N30°E and 3±1 mm/yr of right-lateral shear across this axis. On the basis of these values and earthquake focal mechanisms in the area, we infer that the deformation occurs on northwest trending folds and thrusts within the belt. These results are consistent with the rate and direction of deformation across the central California Coast Ranges inferred by balancing Pacific-North America plate motion against San Andreas slip and Basin and Range extension. They imply that the Santa Maria Fold and Thrust Belt is the primary active element in transforming motion from the Coast Ranges to the western Transverse Ranges and the Santa Barbara Channel.},

These velocities and the associated strain-rate field indicate that the central part of the range is currently dominated by east-west extension, whereas the southern part shows north-south to northwest-southeast compression. The geodetic and seismotectonic data are consistent with a model where strain is essentially controlled by the counterclockwise rotation of the Adriatic microplate with respect to Eurasia. This rotation, together with the arcuate shape of the contact between the Adriatic microplate and the Alps, induces dextral shear kinematic boundary conditions across the Western Alps, with an additional divergence component in their central part and in Switzerland, and a convergence component in their southern part.},

We interpolate the velocities to construct a regional strain rate map beyond the Los Angeles basin. Our results generally agree with the model proposed by the Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities in 1995. Important regional findings of this study are as follows: (1) There is a significant N-S convergence and E-W extension, about 0.22 and 0.17 ± 0.05/$\mu$strain/yr, respectively, for the two components, along the southern frontal fault system of the San Gabriel Mountains. (2) The crustal deformation around the Big Bend of the San Andreas fault (SAF) cannot be explained solely by wrench-style motion across the SAF. Remaining motion could be part of a NW-SE extension which is the response to NE-SW compression in the central Transverse Ranges region. Alternatively, it could be caused by left-lateral faulting on an oblique blind thrust beneath the San Gabriel Mountains. (3) Low strain rates are found along the Elsinore fault and Newport-Inglewood fault. (4) North-south compression decreases from the Raymond Hill fault westward to the Santa Monica fault. There is little east-west extension along this fault system.},

abstract = {The M 7.3 June 28, 1992 Landers and M 7.1 October 16, 1999 Hector Mine earthquakes, California, both right lateral strike-slip events on NNW-trending subvertical faults, occurred in close proximity in space and time in a region where recurrence times for surface-rupturing earthquakes are thousands of years. This suggests a causal role for the Landers earthquake in triggering the Hector Mine earthquake. Previous modeling of the static stress change associated with the Landers earthquake shows that the area of peak Hector Mine slip lies where the Coulomb failure stress promoting right-lateral strike-slip failure was high, but the nucleation point of the Hector Mine rupture was neutrally to weakly promoted, depending on the assumed coefficient of friction. Possible explanations that could account for the 7-year delay between the two ruptures include background tectonic stressing, dissipation of fluid pressure gradients, rate- and state-dependent friction effects, and post-Landers viscoelastic relaxation of the lower crust and upper mantle. By employing a viscoelastic model calibrated by geodetic data collected during the time period between the Landers and Hector Mine events, we calculate that postseismic relaxation produced a transient increase in Coulomb failure stress of about 0.7 bars on the impending Hector Mine rupture surface. The increase is greatest over the broad surface that includes the 1999 nucleation point and the site of peak slip further north. Since stress changes of magnitude greater than or equal to 0.1 bar are associated with documented causal fault interactions elsewhere, viscoelastic relaxation likely contributed to the triggering of the Hector Mine earthquake. This interpretation relies on the assumption that the faults occupying the central Mojave Desert (i.e., both the Landers and Hector Mine rupturing faults) were critically stressed just prior to the Landers earthquake.},

Because a log(t) time dependence is characteristic of transient (primary) creep, the early postseismic response may be governed by transient creep as Benioff proposed in 1951. That inference is provisional as the stress conditions prevailing in postseismic relaxation are not identical to the constant stress condition in creep experiments. The observed logarithmic time dependence includes no characteristic time that might aid in identifying the micromechanical cause.},

abstract = {We have modeled postseismic deformation from 1999 to 2003 in the region surrounding the 1999 Izmit and Duzce earthquake ruptures, using a three-dimensional viscoelastic finite element method. Our models confirm earlier findings that surface deformation within the first few months of the Izmit earthquake is principally due to stable frictional afterslip on and below the Izmit earthquake rupture. A second deformation process is required, however, to fit the surface deformation after several months. Viscoelastic relaxation of lower crust and/or upper mantle with a viscosity of the order of 2 to 5 x 10(19) Pa s improves the models' fit to later GPS site velocities. However, for a linear viscous rheology, this range of values is inconsistent with highly localized interseismic deformation around the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) that was well observed prior to the earthquake sequence. The simplest solution to this problem is to assume that the effective viscosity of the relaxing material increases with time after large earthquakes, that is, that it has a power law or Burger's body (transient) rheology. A Burger's body rheology with two characteristic viscosities (2 to 5 x 10(19) Pa s and at least 2 x 10(20) Pa s) in the mantle is consistent with deformation around the NAFZ throughout the earthquake cycle.},

We derive the full vector displacement field due to the Bam, Iran, earthquake of moment magnitude 6.5 using radar data from the Envisat satellite of the European Space Agency. Analysis of surface deformation indicates that most of the seismic moment release along the 20-km-long strike-slip rupture occurred at a shallow depth of 4-5 km, yet the rupture did not break the surface. The Bam event may therefore represent an end-member case of the 'shallow slip deficit' model, which postulates that coseismic slip in the uppermost crust is systematically less than that at seismogenic depths (4-10 km). The InSAR-derived surface displacement data from the Bam and other large shallow earthquakes suggest that the uppermost section of the seismogenic crust around young and developing faults may undergo a distributed failure in the interseismic period, thereby accumulating little elastic strain.},

abstract = {The anterior aspect of the mouse primitive streak resembles the organizer of Xenopus and chick in terms of its developmental fate, ability to alter pattern in the chick limb bud and with respect to the repertoire of genes that its constituent cells express. However, until now there has been no direct evidence that the mouse node organizes pattern during gastrulation, nor that the exceptionally small mouse embryonic egg cylinder can be induced to form a second axis. Grafts of transgenically marked midgastrulation mouse node, or node labelled with DiI, to a posterolateral location in a host embryo of the same developmental stage results in the induction of a second neural axis and the formation of ectopic somites. The graft gives rise predominantly to notochord and endoderm tissue whereas the neurectoderm and somites are mainly of host origin. The ectopic notochord formed is derived solely from the donor node which suggests that the node can serve as a 'stem cell' source of axial mesoderm. This is corroborated by the observation that labelling in situ the population of cells on the outer surface of the mid-gastrulation node with DiI results in continuous labelling of the notochord. DiI-labelled cells are present throughout the notochord from a rostral boundary in the cranial region to its most caudal extreme and the node itself always remains labelled.},

abstract = {Two GPS geodetic surveys across the Basin and Range (BR) province of western North America have detected an anomalous compression east of the Central Nevada Seismic Belt (CNSB). The first network, installed by the U. S. Geological Survey along an east-west trending transect across the BR at approximately 40degreesN, consisted of 63 monuments observed campaign style in 1992, 1996, and 1998. The second network, installed by the California Institute of Technology, consisted of 50 continuously operating GPS receivers, 18 of which were roughly along the same transect as the campaign survey. We have used a viscoelastic postseismic relaxation model of the four largest earthquakes in the CNSB (on the Pleasant Valley fault in 1915, the Cedar Mountain fault in 1932, and on the Fairview Peak and Dixie Valley faults in 1954) to interpret the geodetic velocities observed across the CNSB. A model of postseismic relaxation with a lower crustal Maxwell viscosity of 5-50 x 10(18) Pa s can explain the apparent compression regardless of the assumed mantle viscosity. The geodetic velocities that we determined after removing the postseismic contribution indicate that within current GPS detection limits the BR is stable east of the CNSB and is undergoing rapid right-lateral shear west of the CNSB.},

abstract = {We investigate the coseismic and postseismic deformation due to the Mw 6.0 2004 Parkfield, California, earthquake. We produce coseismic and postseismic slip models by inverting data from an array of 14 continuous GPS stations from the SCIGN network. Kinematic inversions of postseismic GPS data over a time period of 3 years show that afterslip occurred in areas of low seismicity and low coseismic slip, predominantly at a depth of 5 km. Inversions suggest that coseismic stress increases were relaxed by predominantly aseismic afterslip on a fault plane. The kinetics of afterslip is consistent with a velocity-strengthening friction generalized to include the case of infinitesimal velocities. We performed simulations of stress-driven creep using a numerical model that evaluates the time-dependent deformation due to coseismic stress changes in a viscoelastoplastic half-space. Starting with a coseismic slip distribution, we compute the time-dependent evolution of afterslip on a fault plane and the associated displacements at the GPS stations.

We also find that the geodetic moment due to creep is a factor of 100 greater than the cumulative seismic moment of aftershocks. The rate of aftershocks in the top 10 km of the seismogenic zone mirrors the kinetics of afterslip, suggesting that postearthquake seismicity is governed by loading from the nearby aseismic creep. The San Andreas fault around Parkfield is deduced to have large along-strike variations in rate-and-state frictional properties. Velocity strengthening areas may be responsible for the separation of the coseismic slip in two distinct asperities and for the ongoing aseismic creep occurring between the velocity-weakening patches after the 2004 rupture.},

abstract = {Maps of surface displacement following the 1992 Landers, California, earthquake, generated by interferometric processing of {\{}ERS-1{\}} synthetic aperture radar ({\{}SAR){\}} images, reveal effects of various postseismic deformation processes along the 1992 surface rupture. The large-scale pattern of the postseismic displacement field includes large lobes, mostly visible on the west side of the fault, comparable in shape with the lobes observed in the coseismic displacement field. This pattern and the steep displacement gradient observed near the Emerson-Camp Rock fault cannot be simply explained by afterslip on deep sections of the 1992 rupture. Models show that horizontal slip occurring on a buried dislocation in a Poisson's material produces a characteristic quadripole pattern in the surface displacement field with several centimeters of vertical motion at distances of 10–20 km from the fault, yet this pattern is not observed in the postseismic interferograms. As previously proposed to explain local strain in the fault step overs [Peltzer et al., 1996b], we argue that poroelastic rebound caused by pore fluid flow may also occur over greater distances from the fault, compensating the vertical ground shift produced by fault afterslip. Such a rebound is explained by the gradual change of the crustal rocks' Poisson's ratio value from undrained (coseismic) to drained (postseismic) conditions as pore pressure gradients produced by the earthquake dissipate. Using the Poisson's ratio values of 0.27 and 0.31 for the drained and undrained crustal rocks, respectively, elastic dislocation models show that the combined contributions of afterslip on deep sections of the fault and poroelastic rebound can account for the range change observed in the {\{}SAR{\}} data and the horizontal displacement measured at Global Positioning System ({\{}GPS){\}} sites along a 60-km-long transect across the Emerson fault [Savage and Svarc, 1997]. Using a detailed surface slip distribution on the Homestead Valley, Kickapoo, and Johnson Valley faults, we modeled the poroelastic rebound in the Homestead Valley pull apart. A Poisson's ratio value of 0.35 for the undrained gouge rocks in the fault zone is required to account for the observed surface uplift in the 3.5 years following the earthquake. This large value implies a seismic velocity ratio {\{}Vp/Vs{\}} of 2.1, consistent with the observed low Vs values of fault zone guided waves at shallow depth [Li et al., 1997]. The {\{}SAR{\}} data also reveal postseismic creep along shallow patches of the Eureka Peak and Burnt Mountain faults with a characteristic decay time of 0.8 years. Coseismic, dilatant hardening (locking process) followed by post-seismic, pore pressure controlled fault creep provide a plausible mechanism to account for the decay time of the observed slip rate along this section of the fault.},

abstract = {To interpret short-term postseismic surface displacements in the context of key ambient conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, background strain rate, water content, creep mechanism), we combined steady state and transient flow into a single constitutive relation that can explain the response of a viscoelastic material to a change in stress. The flow law is then used to investigate mantle deformation beneath the Eastern California Shear Zone following the 1999 M7.1 Hector Mine earthquake. The flow law parameters are determined using finite element models of relaxation processes, constrained by surface displacement time series recorded by 55 continuous GPS stations for 7 years following the earthquake. Results suggest that postseismic flow following the Hector Mine earthquake occurs below a depth of ∼50 km and is controlled by dislocation creep of wet olivine. Diffusion creep models can also explain the data, but require a grain size (3.5 mm) that is smaller than the inferred grain size (10–20 mm) based on the mantle conditions at these depths. In addition, laboratory flow laws predict dislocation creep would dominate at the stress/grain size conditions that provide the best fit to diffusion creep models. Model results suggest a transient creep phase that lasts ∼1 year and has a viscosity ∼10 times lower than subsequent steady state flow, in general agreement with laboratory observations. The postseismic response is best explained as occurring within a relatively hot upper mantle (e.g., 1200–1300°C at 50 km depth) with a long-term background mantle strain rate of 0.1–0.2$\mu$strain/yr, consistent with the observed surface strain rate. Long-term background shear stresses at the top of the mantle are ∼4 MPa, then decrease with depth to a minimum of 0.1–0.2 MPa at 70 km depth before increasing slowly with depth due to the pressure dependence of viscosity. These conditions correspond to a background viscosity of 1021 Pa s within a thin mantle lid that decreases to ∼5 × 1019 Pa s within the underlying asthenosphere. This study shows the utility of using short-term postseismic observations to infer long-term mantle conditions that are not readily observable by other means.},

abstract = {To determine crustal motions in and around southern California, we have processed and combined trilateration data collected from 1970 to 1992, VLBI data from 1979 to 1992, and GPS data from 1986 to 2004: a long temporal coverage required in part by the occurrence of several large earthquakes in this region. From a series of solutions for station positions, we have estimated interseismic velocities, coseismic displacements, and postseismic motions. Within the region from 31°N to 38°N. and east to 114°W, the final product includes estimated horizontal velocities for 1009 GPS, 190 trilateration, and 16 VLBI points, with ties between some of these used to stabilize the solution. All motions are relative to the Stable North American Reference Frame (SNARF) as realized through the velocities of 20 GPS stations. This provides a relatively dense set of horizontal velocity estimates, with well-tested errors, for the past quarter century over the plate boundary from 31°N to 36.5°N. These velocities agree well with those from the Plate Boundary Observatory, which apply to a later time period. We also estimated vertical velocities, 533 of which have errors below 2 mm/yr. Most of these velocities are less than 1 mm/yr, but they show 2–4 mm/yr subsidence in the Ventura and Los Angeles basins and in the Salton Trough. Our analysis also included estimates of coseismic and postseismic motions related to the 1992 Landers, 1994 Northridge, 1999 Hector Mine, and 2003 San Simeon earthquakes. Postseismic motions increase logarithmically over time with a time constant of about 10 days, and generally mimic the direction and relative amplitude of the coseismic offsets.},

abstract = {We have developed dynamic finite-element models of [I]zmit earthquake postseismic deformation to evaluate whether this deformation is better explained by afterslip (via either velocity-strengthening frictional slip or linear viscous creep) or by distributed linear viscoelastic relaxation of the lower crust. We find that velocity-strengthening frictional afterslip driven by coseismic shear stress loading can reproduce time-dependent Global Positioning System data better than either linear viscous creep on a vertical shear zone below the rupture or lower crustal viscoelastic relaxation. Our best frictional afterslip model fits the main features of postseismic slip inversions, in particular, high slip patches at (and below) the hypocenter and on the western Karadere segment, and limited afterslip west of the Hersek Delta (Burgmann et al., 2002). The model requires a weakly velocity-strengthening fault, that is, either low effective normal stress in the slipping regions or a smaller value for the parameter describing rate-dependence of friction (a-b) than is indicated by laboratory experiments. Our best afterslip model suggests that the Coulomb stress at the Duzce hypocenter increased by 0.14 MPa (1.4 bars) during the [I]zmit earthquake (assuming right-lateral slip on a surface dipping 50{\{}degrees{\}} to the north), and by another 0.1 MPa during the 87 days between the [I]zmit and Duzce earthquakes. In the Marmara Sea region (within about 160 km of the [I]zmit earthquake rupture), this model indicates that the Coulomb stresses increased by 15{\%}-25{\%} of the coseismic amount during the first 300 days after the earthquake. Three hundred days after the earthquake, postseismic contributions to Coulomb stressing rate on the Maramara region faults had fallen to values equal to or less than the inferred secular stress accumulation rate. Our estimates of postseismic Coulomb stress are highly model dependent: in the Marmara region, the linear viscous shear zone and viscoelastic lower crust models predict greater postseismic Coulomb stresses than the frictional afterslip model. Near-field stress and fault-zone rheology estimates are sensitive to the Earth's elastic structure. When a layered elastic structure is incorporated in our model, it yields a Coulomb stress of 0.24 MPa at the Duzce hypocenter, significantly more than the 0.14 MPa estimated from the uniform elastic model. Because of the higher near-field coseismic stresses, the layered elastic model requires a higher value of velocity-strengthening parameter (A-B) ([a-b] times effective normal stress r') to produce comparable postseismic slip. (A-B) is estimated at 0.4 and 0.2 MPa, respectively, for the layered and uniform elastic models. These results highlight the importance of understanding the Earth's elastic structure and the mechanism for postseismic deformation if we wish to accurately model coseismic and postseismic crustal stresses.},

abstract = {We present an algorithm to calculate horizontal strains (or strain rates) through interpolation of geodetically derived displacements (or velocities). This is an underdetermined inverse problem to derive smoothly distributed strains (or strain rates) using spatially discretized geodetic observations. A priori information, in the form of weighted smoothing, is critical to facilitate the solution. At a given site, the horizontal displacement (or velocity) field in its vicinity is approximated by a bilinear function and represented by rigid block translation, rotation, and strains (or their rates). The weighted displacement (or velocity) data in the neighborhood are used to estimate the field parameters through a least‐squares inversion procedure. Optimal weightings are prescribed for the neighboring data, based on their distances to the interpolation site and their spatial coverage. Nonelastic strains resulted from surface fault rupture and creep may also be excluded from the solution. We apply this method to the Southern California Earthquake Center Crustal Motion Map version 4.0 velocity field and derive the strain‐rate field in southern California. Our result shows that (1) distance‐dependent weighting can be optimally achieved by employing either a Gaussian or quadratic decay function, with the former offering a slightly sharper result than the latter. (2) Spatially dependent weighting is important to improve the interpolation, and can be done by invoking either an azimuthal weighting or a Voronoi cell areal weighting function. (3) The strain‐rate pattern in southern California is dominated by dextral shear of the San Andreas fault (SAF) system, and the secondary faults surrounding the Big Bend of the SAF strike at oblique angles with respect to the maximum shear direction, suggesting that tectonic deformation field on and off the SAF is dominated by mechanic processes of the SAF. },

Using reasonable values for the physical state of the upper mantle, the viscosities predicted by extrapolation of the experimental flow laws compare well with independent estimates for the viscosity of the oceanic mantle, which is approximately 1019 Pa s at a depth of ∼100 km. The viscosity of the mantle wedge of subduction zones could be even lower if the flux of water through it can result in olivine water contents greater than those estimated for the oceanic asthenosphere and promote the onset of melting. Calculations of the partitioning of water between hydrous melt and mantle peridotite suggest that the water content of the residue of arc melting is similar to that estimated for the asthenosphere. Thus, transport of water from the slab into the mantle wedge can continually replenish the water content of the upper mantle and facilitate the existence of a low viscosity asthenosphere.},

This limit is a primary control for ground motion hazard at near-coastal cities. The studies also provide information on the physical controls of subduction thrust rupture globally. The constraints are (1) “locked/transition” zones from geodetic deformation (GPS, repeated leveling, tide gauges); (2) rupture zone from paleoseismic coastal marsh subsidence, “paleogeodesy”; (3) temperature on the thrust for the seismic-aseismic transition; (4) change in thrust seismic reflection character downdip from thin seismic to thick ductile; (5) fore-arc mantle corner aseismic serpentinite and talc overlying the thrust; (6) updip limit of episodic tremor and slip (ETS) slow slip; (7) rupture area associations with shelf-slope basins; (8) depth limit for small events on the thrust; and (9) landward limit of earthquakes on the Nootka transform fault zone. The most reliable constraints for the limit of large rupture displacement, {\textgreater}10 m, are generally just offshore in agreement with thermal control for this hot subduction zone, but well-offshore central Oregon and near the coast of northern Washington. The limit for 1–2 m rupture that can still provide strong shaking is less well estimated 25–50 km farther landward. The fore-arc mantle corner and the updip extent of ETS slow slip are significantly landward from the other constraints. Surprisingly, there is a downdip gap between the best other estimates for the great earthquake rupture zone and the ETS slow slip. In this gap, plate convergence may occur as continuous slow creep.},

abstract = {Viscoelastic relaxation of a ductile asthenosphere underlying a purely elastic plate is a strong candidate process for explaining anomalous rates of crustal deformation observed following large earthquakes. The nongravitational treatment of Pollitz [1992], which is valid on a global scale and includes the effects of compressibility, is here extended to permit the calculation of gravitational viscoelastic relaxation for a specified spherically layered viscoelastic rheology following an earthquake in an elastic layer. The simple approximations we adopt make the resulting treatment particularly suitable for near-field calculations. For an asthenosphere with a Maxwell rheology, the effect of gravitational coupling is manifested only many relaxation times after the earthquake, as obtained by previous investigators. Its effect is generally to speed up the long-wavelength component of the relaxation process and attenuate the overall vertical displacement pattern. Several subtle features common to the relaxation behavior from several different fault types (thrust, rift, and strike-slip) are identified. The effect of gravitational coupling on horizontal displacements is consistent with flexure of the upper elastic plate driven by the corresponding effects on the vertical displacement. Stress diffusion away from the source region generally exhibits pulse-like behavior which is dispersive in both space and time. If the asthenosphere is confined to a relatively narrow channel, then the dispersion branches governing relaxation are radically altered, and stress diffusion effects far from the coseismic rupture zone exhibit a complicated time dependence reflecting the competing tendencies of toroidal and spheroidal mode relaxation.},

abstract = {The nonequispaced Fourier transform arises in a variety of application area:, from medical imaging to radio astronomy to the numerical solution of partial differential equations. In a typical problem, one is given an irregular sampling of N data in the frequency domain and one is interested in reconstructing the corresponding function in the physical domain. When the sampling is uniform, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) allows this calculation to be computed in O(N log N) operations rather than O(N-2) operations. Unfortunately, when the sampling is nonuniform, the FFT does not apply. Over the last few years, a number of algorithms have been developed to overcome this limitation and are often referred to as nonuniform FFTs (NUFFTs). These rely on a mixture of interpolation and the judicious use of the FFT on an oversampled grid (A. Dutt and V. Rokhlin, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 14 (1993), pp. 1368-1383). In this paper, we observe that one of the standard interpolation or "gridding" schemes, based on Gaussians, can be accelerated by a significant factor without precomputation and storage of the interpolation weights. This is of particular value in two- and three-dimensional settings, saving either 10(d)N in storage in d dimensions or a factor of about 5-10 in CPU time (independent of dimension).},

abstract = {Time series analysis of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, GPS measurements, and field observations reveal that the central section of the Izmit (Turkey) fault that slipped with a supershear rupture velocity in the A.D. 1999, Mw7.4, Izmit earthquake began creeping aseismically following the earthquake. Rapid initial postseismic afterslip decayed logarithmically with time and appears to have reached a steady rate comparable to the pre-earthquake full fault-crossing rate, suggesting that it may continue for decades and possibly until late in the earthquake cycle. If confirmed by future monitoring, these observations identify postseismic afterslip as a mechanism for initiating creep behavior along strike-slip faults. Long-term afterslip and/or creep has significant implications for earthquake cycle models, recurrence intervals of large earthquakes, and accordingly, seismic hazard estimation along mature strike-slip faults, in particular for Istanbul which is believed to lie adjacent to a seismic gap along the North Anatolian fault in the Sea of Marmara.},

abstract = {Geodetic data indicate that the M7.1 Hector Mine, California, earthquake was followed by a brief period (a few weeks) of rapid deformation preceding a prolonged phase of slower deformation. We find that the signal contained in continuous and campaign global positioning system data for 2.5 years after the earthquake may be explained with a transient rheology. Quantitative modeling of these data with allowance for transient (linear biviscous) rheology in the lower crust and upper mantle demonstrates that transient rheology in the upper mantle is dominant, its material properties being typified by two characteristic relaxation times ???0.07 and ???2 years. The inferred mantle rheology is a Jeffreys solid in which the transient and steady-state shear moduli are equal. Consideration of a simpler viscoelastic model with a linear univiscous rheology (2 fewer parameters than a biviscous model) shows that it consistently underpredicts the amplitude of the first ???3 months signal, and allowance for a biviscous rheology is significant at the 99.0{\%} confidence level. Another alternative model - deep postseismic afterslip beneath the coseismic rupture - predicts a vertical velocity pattern opposite to the observed pattern at all time periods considered. Despite its plausibility, the advocated biviscous rheology model is non-unique and should be regarded as a viable alternative to the non-linear mantle rheology model for governing postseismic flow beneath the Mojave Desert.

abstract = {Numerical models of the strike-slip earthquake cycle, assuming a viscoelastic asthenosphere coupling model, are examined. The time-dependent simulations incorporate a stress-driven fault, which leads to tectonic stress fields and earthquake recurrence histories that are mutually consistent. Single-fault simulations with constant far-field plate motion lead to a nearly periodic earthquake cycle and a distinctive spatial distribution of crustal shear stress. The predicted stress distribution includes a local minimum in stress at depths less than typical seismogenic depths. The width of this stress 'trough' depends on the magnitude of crustal stress relative to asthenospheric drag stresses. The models further predict a local near-fault stress maximum at greater depths, sustained by the cyclic transfer of strain from the elastic crust to the ductile asthenosphere. Models incorporating both low-stress and high-stress fault strength assumptions are examined, under Newtonian and non-Newtonian rheology assumptions. Model results suggest a preference for low-stress (a shear stress level of about 10 MPa) fault models, in agreement with previous estimates based on heat flow measurements and other stress indicators.},

abstract = {SUMMARY We have obtained general expressions for quasi-static internal deformation fields due to a dislocation source in a multilayered elastic/viscoelastic half-space under gravity by applying the correspondence principle of linear viscoelasticity to the associated elastic solution (Fukahata {\&} Matsu'ura 2005). The use of the upgoing propagator matrix for the region below the source and the downgoing propagator matrix for the region above the source in the derivation of mathematical expressions guarantees the numerical stability of the obtained viscoelastic solution over the whole region. The viscoelastic deformation fields due to a dislocation source tend to a certain steady state with the progress of viscoelastic stress relaxation. The completely relaxed viscoelastic solution can be directly obtained from the associated elastic solution by taking the rigidity of the elastic layer corresponding to a Maxwell viscoelastic layer to be zero. We gave an explicit mathematical proof of this theoretical relationship, which we named the equivalence theorem, on the basis of the correspondence principle of linear viscoelasticity and the limiting value theorem of the Laplace transform. The equivalence theorem is applicable not only to the elastic-viscoelastic stratified medium but also to general elastic and linear-viscoelastic composite media. As numerical examples we show the quasi-static internal displacement fields due to strike-slip motion on a vertical fault and dip-slip motion on a subduction plate boundary in an elastic surface layer overlying a viscoelastic half-space. The temporal variation of the computed deformation fields shows that the effective relaxation time of the elastic-viscoelastic system is much longer than the Maxwell relaxation time defined by the ratio of viscosity to rigidity in the viscoelastic layer.},

abstract = {The seismicity of southern California results from stresses that arise from the relative motion of the Pacific and North American Plates being accommodated along the San Andreas Fault (SAF) system and the Eastern California Shear Zone (ECSZ). Here we calculate how the stress field in southern California has evolved over the past two centuries due to interseismic loading, as inferred from current GPS observations of surface velocities, from redistributions of static stress induced by large (M-w {\textgreater}= 6.5) earthquakes since the 1812 Wrightwood quake, and postseismic viscoelastic relaxation associated with these events that serves to transfer coseismic stresses from the deep, warm, lower crust and upper mantle to the overlying seismogenic upper crust. We calculate Coulomb stress changes on vertical strike-slip faults striking parallel to the SAF and at the hypocenters on the rupture planes of all M-w {\textgreater}= 6 events over the past two centuries. Our results suggest that the 1857 M-w = 8.2 Fort Tejon earthquake, by far the largest event to have occurred in the region over the past two centuries, had a profound influence on the state of stress in Southern California during the 19th century, inducing significant stress increases to the north (Parkfield region and adjoining creeping SAF) and south (southern SAF and San Jacinto fault), and stress relief across the southern ECSZ. These stress changes were then greatly magnified by postseismic relaxation through the early part of the 20th century. Slow interseismic build-up of stress further loads all major strike-slip faults and works to reload the areas of the ECSZ where stress was relieved by the 1857 quake. Our calculations suggest that only 56{\%} of hypocenters were pushed closer to failure by preceding coseismic stress changes, suggesting that the occurrence of large earthquakes is not strongly determined by coseismic Coulomb stress changes. This percentage rises to 70{\%} when postseismic stress changes are also considered. Our calculations demonstrate the importance of postseismic viscoelastic relaxation in the redistribution of stress following large earthquakes. We find, however, that postseismic processes associated with events more than about a decade old are near completion and thus do not significantly influence the regional velocity field presently observed in southern California.},

abstract = {Geological studies show evidence for temporal clustering of large earthquakes on individual fault systems. Since post-seismic deformation due to the inelastic rheology of the lithosphere may result in a variable loading rate on a fault throughout the interseismic period, it is reasonable to expect that the rheology of the non-seismogenic lower crust and mantle lithosphere may play a role in controlling earthquake recurrence times. We study this phenomenon using a 2-D, finite element method continuum model of the lithosphere containing a single strike-slip fault. This model builds on a previous study using a 1-D spring-dashpot-slider analogue of a single fault system to study the role of Maxwell viscoelastic relaxation in producing non-periodic earthquakes. In our 2-D model, the seismogenic portion of the fault slips when a predetermined yield stress is exceeded; stress accumulated on the seismogenic fault is shed to the viscoelastic layers below and recycled back to the seismogenic fault through viscoelastic relaxation. We find that random variation of the fault yield stress from one earthquake to the next can cause the earthquake sequence to be clustered; the amount of clustering depends on a non-dimensional number, W, called the Wallace number defined as the standard deviation of the randomly varied fault yield stress divided by the effective viscosity of the system times the tectonic loading rate. A new clustering metric based on the bimodal distribution of interseismic intervals allows us to investigate clustering behaviour of systems over a wide range of model parameters and those with multiple viscoelastic layers. For models with W greater than or similar to 1 clustering increases with increasing W, while those with W less than or similar to 1 are unclustered, or quasi-periodic.},

We demonstrate the theory for models of an elastic layer over a Maxwell, standard linear solid, Burgers, and triviscous half-space.

Combining 1 Hz kinematic GPS, static GPS offsets, seafloor geodesy and near-field and far-field tsunami data into a massively parallel Monte Carlo simulation, we construct an ensemble of samples of the posterior probability density function describing the evolution of fault rupture. We find that most of the slip is concentrated in a depth range of 10-20 km from the trench, and that slip decreases towards the trench with significant displacements at the toe of wedge occurring in just a small region. Estimates of static stress drop and rupture velocity are ambiguous. Due to the spatial compactness of the fault rupture, the duration of the entire rupture was less than approximately 150 s.},

The lake encompasses an area of 635 km(2), and the total volume of the reservoir is 35.5 km(3) Filling started in February 1935. On the basis of a first-order leveling in 1935, several levelings were carried out to measure the deformation induced by the load of the reservoir. Subsidence in the central parts of the lake relative to the first leveling was around 120 mm (1941), 218 mm (1950), and 200 mm (1963). The subsidence pattern clearly shows relaxation of the underlying basement due to the water load of the lake, which ceased after 1950. Modeling of the relaxation process by means of layered, viscoelastic, compressible flat Earth models with a detailed representation of the spatial and temporal distribution of the water load shows that the thickness of the elastic crust underneath Lake Mead is 30+/-3 km. The data are also consistent with a 10-km-thick elastic upper crust and a 20-km-thick viscoelastic lower crust, with 10(20) Pa s as a lower bound for its viscosity. The subcrust has an average viscosity of 10(18+/-0.2) Pa s, a surprisingly low value. The leveling data constrain the viscosity profile down to similar to 200 km depth.},

abstract = {We performed laboratory experiments to investigate shear localization and the evolution of frictional behavior as a function of shear strain. Experiments were conducted on water-saturated layers, 0.3–1 cm thick, of Caesar till, a granular material analogous to fault gouge. We used the double-direct shear configuration at normal stresses ranging from 0.5 to 5 MPa and shearing velocities of 10–100 mm/s. Shear localization was assessed via strain markers and two proxies: (1) macroscopic layer dilation in response to perturbations in shear stress and (2) rate/state friction response to shear velocity perturbations. In creep mode experiments, at constant shear stress, we monitored dilation for perturbations in shear stress. In standard friction tests, we measured the coefficient of friction during perturbations in macroscopic strain rate. We find evidence of strain localization beginning at shear strain g  0.15 and continuing until g  1. Analysis of strain markers supports interpretations based on the proxies for localization and shows that strain is localized in zones of finite thickness. We also investigate symmetry of the friction response to step changes in imposed slip velocity and find that the behavior is symmetric. Our results favor the Ruina law for friction state evolution in which slip is the fundamental variable rather than the Dieterich law. The critical slip distance for friction evolution, Dc,is 140 mm. The Dieterich state evolution law requires different values of Dc for velocity increases/decreases, 100 mm versus 175 mm, respectively, and would imply strain localization/delocalization associated with shear in a finite zone},

abstract = {To understand whether the 1992 M = 7.4 Landers earthquake changed the proximity to failure on the San Andreas fault system, we examine the general problem of how one earthquake might trigger another. The tendency of rocks to fail in a brittle manner is thought to be a function of both shear and confining stresses, commonly formulated as the Coulomb failure criterion. Here we explore how changes in Coulomb conditions associated with one or more earthquakes may trigger subsequent events. We first consider a Coulomb cri- terion appropriate for the production of aftershocks, where faults most likely to slip are those optimally orientated for failure as a result of the prevailing re- gional stress field and the stress change caused by the mainshock. We find that the distribution of aftershocks for the Landers earthquake, as well as for several other moderate events in its vicinity, can be explained by the Coulomb criterion as follows: aftershocks are abundant where the Coulomb stress on optimally orientated faults rose by more than one-half bar, and aftershocks are sparse where the Coulomb stress dropped by a similar amount. Further, we find that several moderate shocks raised the stress at the future Landers epicenter and along much of the Landers rupture zone by about a bar, advancing the Landers shock by 1 to 3 centuries. The Landers rupture, in turn, raised the stress at site of the future M = 6.5 Big Bear aftershock site by 3 bars. The Coulomb stress change on a specified fault is independent of regional stress but depends on the fault geometry, sense of slip, and the coefficient of friction. We use this method to resolve stress changes on the San Andreas and San Jacinto faults imposed by the Landers sequence. Together the Landers and Big Bear earthquakes raised the stress along the San Bernardino segment of the southern San Andreas fault by 2 to 6 bars, hastening the next great earthquake there by about a decade.

abstract = {The transient creep behaviour of two natural dunites has been investigated at temperatures between 1373 and 1573 K and a confining pressure of 300 MPa in a high-resolution gas-medium deformation apparatus. The specimens were deformed in constant stress experiments in the presence of an aqueous phase and were oriented perpendicular to foliation. The results confirm the finding of earlier workers that the high-temperature transient flow properties of olivine rocks can be effectively modelled in terms of a Burgers' body rheology. Observations of time-dependent strain recovery after unloading further support this model. The viscosity in the transient regime ($\eta$1) is found to have the same sensitivity to temperature and stress (within the errors of each estimate) as has been found previously for steady-state creep viscosity ($\eta$2). Thus the ratio $\eta$2$\eta$1 is found to be relatively insensitive to temperature and stress with values between 0.17 and 0.67. These values are higher than the $\eta$2$\eta$1 = 0.1 that has generally been assumed in geophysical modelling of upper mantle transient deformation but are similar to the results of previous experiments with olivine single crystals. The ratio of the shear moduli in the transient and steady-state regimes ($\mu$2$\mu$1) is found to be weakly sensitive to temperature at 250 MPa stress and 300 MPa confining pressure. The value of $\mu$2$\mu$1 decreases slowly as temperature increases. For the present experiments 0.05 {\textless} $\mu$2$\mu$1 {\textless} 0.36 which is comparable to the range of values reported in previous studies.},

abstract = {We investigate an ongoing silent thrust event in the Tokai seismic gap along the Suruga-Nankai Trough, central Japan. Prior to the event, continuous GPS data from April 1996 to the end of 1999 show that this region displaced similar to 2 cm/yr to the northwest relative to the landward plate. The GPS time series show an abrupt change in rate in mid-June 2000 that continues as of mid-2005. We model this transient deformation, which we refer to as the Tokai slow thrust slip event, as caused by slip on the interface between the Philippine Sea and Amurian plates. The spatial and temporal distribution of slip rate is estimated with Kalman filter based inversion methods. Our inversions reveal two slow subevents. The first initiated in late June 2000 slightly before the Miyake-jima eruption. The locus of slip then propagated southeast in the second half of 2000, with maximum slip rates of about 15 cm/yr through 2001. A second locus of slip initiated to the northeast in early 2001. The depth of the slip zone is about 25 km, which may correspond to the transition zone from a seismogenic to a freely sliding zone. The cumulative moment magnitude of the slow slip event up to November 2002 is M-w similar to 6.8. We calculate shear stress changes on the plate interface from the slip histories. Stress change as a function of slip rate shows trajectories similar to that inferred for high-speed ruptures; however, the maximum velocity is 8 orders of magnitude less than in normal earthquakes.},

abstract = {Far-field continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) time-series data following the 2002 M7.9 Denali, Alaska earthquake imply that mantle viscoelastic rheology is stress-dependent. A linear viscous mantle cannot explain fast early displacement rates at the surface that rapidly decay with time, whereas a power-law rheology where strain rate is proportional to stress raised to the power of 3.5 ± 0.5 provides decay rates and spatial patterns in agreement with observations. This is consistent with laboratory measurements for hot, wet olivine, implying a hydrated mantle and a relatively thin (60-km-thick) lithosphere beneath south-central Alaska. These results suggest that the viscous strength of the lithosphere varies both spatially and temporally, and that effective viscosities inferred from different loading events or observational time-periods can differ by up to several orders of magnitude. Thus, the very conditions that enable the inference of rheologic strength-transient loading and unloading events-significantly alter the effective viscosity. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The estimation of finite fault earthquake source models is an inherently underdetermined problem: there is no unique solution to the inverse problem of determining the rupture history at depth as a function of time and space when our data are limited to observations at the Earth's surface. Bayesian methods allow us to determine the set of all plausible source model parameters that are consistent with the observations, our a priori assumptions about the physics of the earthquake source and wave propagation, and models for the observation errors and the errors due to the limitations in our forward model. Because our inversion approach does not require inverting any matrices other than covariance matrices, we can restrict our ensemble of solutions to only those models that are physically defensible while avoiding the need to restrict our class of models based on considerations of numerical invertibility. We only use prior information that is consistent with the physics of the problem rather than some artefice (such as smoothing) needed to produce a unique optimal model estimate. Bayesian inference can also be used to estimate model-dependent and internally consistent effective errors due to shortcomings in the forward model or data interpretation, such as poor Green's functions or extraneous signals recorded by our instruments. Until recently, Bayesian techniques have been of limited utility for earthquake source inversions because they are computationally intractable for problems with as many free parameters as typically used in kinematic finite fault models. Our algorithm, called cascading adaptive transitional metropolis in parallel (CATMIP), allows sampling of high-dimensional problems in a parallel computing framework. CATMIP combines the Metropolis algorithm with elements of simulated annealing and genetic algorithms to dynamically optimize the algorithm's efficiency as it runs. The algorithm is a generic Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler; it works independently of the model design, a priori constraints and data under consideration, and so can be used for a wide variety of scientific problems. We compare CATMIP's efficiency relative to several existing sampling algorithms and then present synthetic performance tests of finite fault earthquake rupture models computed using CATMIP.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}We present a spherical wavelet-based multiscale approach for estimating a spatial velocity field on the sphere from a set of irregularly spaced geodetic displacement observations. Because the adopted spherical wavelets are analytically differentiable, spatial gradient tensor quantities such as dilatation rate, strain rate and rotation rate can be directly computed using the same coefficients. In a series of synthetic and real examples, we illustrate the benefit of the multiscale approach, in particular, the inherent ability of the method to localize a given deformation field in space and scale as well as to detect outliers in the set of observations. This approach has the added benefit of being able to locally match the smallest resolved process to the local spatial density of observations, thereby both maximizing the amount of derived information while also allowing the comparison of derived quantities at the same scale but in different regions. We also consider the vertical component of the velocity field in our synthetic and real examples, showing that in some cases the spatial gradients of the vertical velocity field may constitute a significant part of the deformation. This formulation may be easily applied either regionally or globally and is ideally suited as the spatial parametrization used in any automatic time-dependent geodetic transient detector.},

abstract = {SUMMARY We examine the effects of rheological layering on post-seismic deformation using models of an elastic layer over a viscoelastic layer and a viscoelastic half-space. We extend a general linear viscoelastic theory we have previously proposed to models with two layers over a half-space, although we only consider univiscous Maxwell and biviscous Burgers rheologies. In layered viscoelastic models, there are multiple mechanical timescales of post-seismic deformation; however, not all of these timescales arise as distinct phases of post-seismic relaxation observed at the surface. The surface displacements in layered models with only univiscous, Maxwell viscoelastic rheologies always exhibit one exponential-like phase of relaxation. Layered models containing biviscous rheologies may produce multiple phases of relaxation, where the distinctness of the phases depends on the geometry and the contrast in strengths between the layers. Post-seismic displacements in models with biviscous rheologies can often be described by logarithmic functions.},

abstract = {Many studies, mostly empirical, have been devoted to finding an optimal shape parameter for radial basis functions (RBF). When exploring the underlying factors that determine what is a good such choice, we are led to consider the Runge phenomenon (RP; best known in cases of high order polynomial interpolation) as a key error mechanism. This observation suggests that it can be advantageous to let the shape parameter vary spatially, rather than assigning a single value to it. Benefits typically include improvements in both accuracy and numerical conditioning. Still another benefit arises if one wishes to improve local accuracy by clustering nodes in selected areas. This idea is routinely used when working with splines or finite element methods. However, local refinement with RBFs may cause RP-type errors unless we use a spatially variable shape paremeter. With this enhancement, RBF approximations combine freedom from meshes with spectral accuracy on irregular domains, and furthermore permit local node clustering to improve the resolution wherever this might be needed. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Burov1995,
abstract = {It is well accepted that the lithosphere may exhibit nonzero mechanical strength over geological time and space scales, associated with the existence of non-lithostatic (deviatoric) stress. The parameter that characterizes the apparent strength of the lithosphere is the flexural rigidity D, which is commonly expressed through the effective elastic thickness (Te) of the lithosphere. Estimates of Te for oceanic lithosphere approximately follow the depth to a specific isotherm (∼600°C), which marks the base of the mechanical lithosphere. The physical meaning and significance of the effective elastic thickness for continents are still enigmatic, because for continental lithosphere estimates of Te bear little relation to specific geological or physical boundaries. Although high observed values of Te (70–90 km for cratons) can be partly explained by the present-day temperature gradients, the low values (10–20 km), in general, cannot. In addition, the elastic plate models are self-inconsistent in that they mostly predict intraplate stresses high enough to lead to inelastic (brittle or ductile) deformation, according to data of rock mechanics. To provide a basis for a physically consistent unified interpretation of the observed variations of Te for continental and oceanic lithosphere, we developed an analytical and numerical approach that allows direct treatment of Te in terms of the lithospheric rheology, thermal structure, and strain/stress distribution. Our technique is based on finding true inelastic and equivalent (effective) elastic solutions for the problem of deformation of the lithosphere with realistic brittleelasto-ductile rheology. We show that the thermal state (thermotectonic age) of the lithosphere is only one of at least three equally important properties that determine apparent values of Te. These other properties are the state of the crust-mantle interface (decoupling of crust and mantle), the thickness and proportions of the mechanically competent crust and mantle, and the local curvature of the plate, which is directly related to the bending stresses. The thickness of the mechanically competent crust and the degree of coupling or decoupling is generally controlled by composition of the upper and lower crust, total thickness of the crust, and by the crustal geotherm. If decoupling takes place, it permits as much as 50{\%} decrease of Te, compared with Te implied from conventional thermal profiles. Comparison of the theoretically predicted Te with inferred values for different regions suggests that the lower crust of most continental plates has a low-temperature activation rheology (such as quartz) which permits crust and mantle decoupling. The curvature of the plate depends on the rheological structure and on the distribution of external loads applied to the plate (e.g., surface topography, sediment fill, and plate-boundary forces). Bending stresses created by major mountain belts are large enough to cause inelastic deformation (brittle failure and a ductile flow) in the underlying plate, which, in turn, leads to a 30 to 80{\%} decrease of Te beneath such belts and less beneath the adjacent regions. The boundary forces and moments (e.g., due to the slab pull, etc.) lead to more localized but even stronger reductions in Te (e.g., plate necking in subduction zones). Our approach provides a feedback between the “observed” Te and rheology, allowing to constrain the lithospheric structure from estimates of Te.},

abstract = {Satellite geodetic techniques that can measure displacements with millimeter-level accuracy reveal transient signals in the deformation fields produced by both moderate and large earthquakes. These post-seismic signals exhibit characteristic time scales ranging from weeks to decades and distance scales from hundreds of meters to hundreds of kilometers. By considering them in the context of the earthquake deformation cycle, we can test hypotheses about the processes driving them and constrain the rheology of the lithosphere. We discuss three broad categories of mechanism: afterslip in the plane of the co-seismic rupture (analogous to a rubber eraser), fluid flow in the fault zone (analogous to a water-laden sponge), and ductile flow in a weak substrate (analogous to a pot of honey).

The data set was supplemented with a special study of 12 years of ISC phase data which yielded an additional 1.75 × 106 travel time observations for P and S waves. In order to obtain satisfactory agreement with the entire data set we were required to take into account anelastic dispersion. The introduction of transverse isotropy into the outer 220 km of the mantle was required in order to satisfy the shorter period fundamental toroidal and spheroidal modes. This anisotropy also improved the fit of the larger data set. The horizontal and vertical velocities in the upper mantle differ by 2–4{\%}, both for P and S waves. The mantle below 220 km is not required to be anisotropic. Mantle Rayleigh waves are surprisingly sensitive to compressional velocity in the upper mantle. High Sn velocities, low Pn velocities and a pronounced low-velocity zone are features of most global inversion models that are suppressed when anisotropy is allowed for in the inversion. The Preliminary Reference Earth Model, PREM, and auxiliary tables showing fits to the data are presented.},

We establish a relationship between horizontal and vertical seasonal oscillations of the Santa Ana aquifer, use this relationship to infer cumulative horizontal anthropogenic motions from cumulative vertical motions caused by water and oil resource management, and estimate horizontal interseismic velocities corrected for anthropogenic effects. Vertical anthropogenic rates from 1992 to 1999 are slower than 3 mm yr−1 in the Santa Ana and San Gabriel aquifers and faster than 5 mm yr−1 in the Chino aquifer and in many oil fields. Inferred horizontal anthropogenic velocities are faster than 1 mm yr−1 at 18 of 46 GPS sites. Northern metropolitan Los Angeles is contracting, with the 25 km south of the San Gabriel Mountains shortening at 4.5 ± 1 mm yr−1 (95{\%} confidence limits). The thrust fault in an elastic edge dislocation model of the observed strain is creeping at 9 ± 2 mm yr−1 beneath and north of a position 6 ± 2 km deep and 8 ± 8 km north of downtown Los Angeles. The model fault is near the Los Angeles segment of the Puente Hills thrust but south of the Sante Fe Springs segment of the thrust. Disagreement between the 6 km locking depth in the model and the 15 km seismogenic depth inferred from earthquakes suggests that the elastic continuum model may be unsatisfactory; models with different stiffnesses of sedimentary basin and crystalline basement must be investigated.},

A theory is presented for modeling the effects of postseismic relaxation on a spherically symmetric earth. For an earthquake point source located in the upper elastic layer, the displacement field is decomposed into its toroidal and spheroidal components. A linear (Maxwell) rheology in the viscoelastic layers is assumed, enabling the use of the correspondence principle for the solutions of the equations of static equilibrium. Displacement and strain fields are then calculated using normal mode summation. Computational results are presented for two simple earthquake sources: a strike slip fault and a uniaxial thrust fault. The patterns of postseismic displacements and strains are found to depend strongly on both the earth model and earthquake source geometry. In particular, the elastic plate thickness, asthenosphere thickness, fault type, and fault length each play a major role in determining the spatial pattern of postseismic relaxation effects. Asthenospheric viscosity controls the temporal pattern of relaxation.},

However, where competence is vertically discontinuous, the surface deformation and deformation at depth may have a range of relationships, including complete independence.

abstract = {We interpret Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements in the northwestern United States and adjacent parts of western Canada to describe relative motions of crustal blocks, locking on faults and permanent deformation associated with convergence between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates. To estimate angular velocities of the oceanic Juan de Fuca and Explorer plates and several continental crustal blocks, we invert the GPS velocities together with seafloor spreading rates, earthquake slip vector azimuths and fault slip azimuths and rates. We also determine the degree to which faults are either creeping aseismically or, alternatively, locked on the block-bounding faults. The Cascadia subduction thrust is locked mainly offshore, except in central Oregon, where locking extends inland. Most of Oregon and southwest Washington rotate clockwise relative to North America at rates of 0.4–1.0 ° Myr–1. No shear or extension along the Cascades volcanic arc has occurred at the mm/yr level during the past decade, suggesting that the shear deformation extending northward from the Walker Lane and eastern California shear zone south of Oregon is largely accommodated by block rotation in Oregon. The general agreement of vertical axis rotation rates derived from GPS velocities with those estimated from palaeomagnetic declination anomalies suggests that the rotations have been relatively steady for 10–15 Ma. Additional permanent dextral shear is indicated within the Oregon Coast Range near the coast. Block rotations in the Pacific Northwest do not result in net westward flux of crustal material—the crust is simply spinning and not escaping. On Vancouver Island, where the convergence obliquity is less than in Oregon and Washington, the contractional strain at the coast is more aligned with Juan de Fuca—North America motion. GPS velocities are fit significantly better when Vancouver Island and the southern Coast Mountains move relative to North America in a block-like fashion. The relative motions of the Oregon, western Washington and Vancouver Island crustal blocks indicate that the rate of permanent shortening, the type that causes upper plate earthquakes, across the Puget Sound region is 4.4 ± 0.3 mm yr–1. This shortening is likely distributed over several faults but GPS data alone cannot determine the partitioning of slip on them. The transition from predominantly shear deformation within the continent south of the Mendocino Triple Junction to predominantly block rotations north of it is similar to changes in tectonic style at other transitions from shear to subduction. This similarity suggests that crustal block rotations are enhanced in the vicinity of subduction zones possibly due to lower resisting stress.},

Compared with the coseismic displacements, the far-field postseismic motions (1–2 fault dimensions away) are proportionally larger than those seen in the near field. The postseismic data are best modeled with two faults: one on the rupture plane and one located in the shallow crust. The upper crustal fault may represent an actual fault or may be indicative of viscous relaxation occurring in the upper crust. The inferred afterslip and/or relaxation moment is approximately 2.9×1018 N m or 22{\%} of the mainshock moment release. We expect that the moment release due to the afterslip and relaxation effectively reduce the earthquake hazard locally.

abstract = {The discovery of slow-slip phenomena has revolutionized our understanding of how faults accommodate relative plate motions. Faults were previously thought to relieve stress either through continuous aseismic sliding, or as earthquakes resulting from instantaneous failure of locked faults. In contrast, slow-slip events proceed so slowly that slip is limited and only low-frequency (or no) seismic waves radiate. We find that slow-slip phenomena are not unique to the depths (tens of kilometres) of subduction zone plate interfaces. They occur on faults in many settings, at numerous scales and owing to various loading processes, including landslides and glaciers. Taken together, the observations indicate that slowly slipping fault surfaces relax most of the accrued stresses through aseismic slip. Aseismic motion can trigger more rapid slip elsewhere on the fault that is sufficiently fast to generate seismic waves. The resulting radiation has characteristics ranging from those indicative of slow but seismic slip, to those typical of earthquakes. The mode of seismic slip depends on the inherent characteristics of the fault, such as the frictional properties. Slow-slip events have previously been classified as a distinct mode of fault slip compared with that seen in earthquakes. We conclude that instead, slip modes span a continuum and are of common occurrence.},

@article{Sagy2007,
abstract = {Principal slip surfaces in fault zones accommodate most of the displacement during earthquakes. The topography of these surfaces is integral to earthquake and fault mechanics, but is practically unknown at the scale of earthquake slip. We use new laser-based methods to map exposed fault surfaces over scales of 10 µm to 120 m. These data provide the first quantitative evidence that fault-surface roughness evolves with increasing slip. Thousands of profiles ranging from 10 µm to {\textgreater}100 m in length show that small-slip faults (slip {\textless}1 m) are rougher than large-slip faults (slip 10-100 m or more) parallel to the slip direction. Surfaces of small-slip faults have asperities over the entire range of observed scales, while large-slip fault surfaces are polished, with RMS values of {\textless}3 mm on profiles as long as 1-2 m. The large-slip surfaces show smooth, elongate, quasi-elliptical bumps that are meters long and as high as ∼1 m. We infer that these bumps evolve during fault maturation. This difference in geometry implies that the nucleation, growth, and termination of earthquakes on evolved faults are fundamentally different than on new ones.},

@article{Murray2002,
abstract = {Probabilistic estimates of earthquake hazard use various models for the temporal distribution of earthquakes, including the 'time-predictable' recurrence model formulated by Shimazaki and Nakata (which incorporates the concept of elastic rebound described as early as 1910 by H. F. Reid). This model states that an earthquake occurs when the fault recovers the stress relieved in the most recent earthquake. Unlike time-independent models (for example, Poisson probability), the time-predictable model is thought to encompass some of the physics behind the earthquake cycle, in that earthquake probability increases with time. The time-predictable model is therefore often preferred when adequate data are available, and it is incorporated in hazard predictions for many earthquake-prone regions, including northern California, southern California, New Zealand and Japan. Here we show that the model fails in what should be an ideal locale for its application -- Parkfield, California. We estimate rigorous bounds on the predicted recurrence time of the magnitude approximately 6 1966 Parkfield earthquake through inversion of geodetic measurements and we show that, according to the time-predictable model, another earthquake should have occurred by 1987. The model's poor performance in a relatively simple tectonic setting does not bode well for its successful application to the many areas of the world characterized by complex fault interactions.},
